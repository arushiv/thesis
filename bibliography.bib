  abstract = {Author summary The epithelium lining the intestine is an ancient animal tissue that serves as a primary site of nutrient absorption and interaction with microbiota. Its formation and function require complex patterns of gene transcription that vary along the intestine and in specialized intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) subtypes. However, it is unknown how the underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have changed over the course of vertebrate evolution. Here, we used genome-wide profiling of mRNA levels and chromatin accessibility to identify conserved IEC genes and regulatory regions in 4 vertebrate species (zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human) separated from a common ancestor by 420 million years. We identified substantial similarities in genes expressed along the vertebrate intestine. These data disclosed putative conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enriched in accessible chromatin near IEC genes and in regulatory sites with accessibility restricted to IECs. Fluorescent reporter assays in transparent zebrafish showed that these regions, which frequently lacked sequence conservation, were still capable of driving conserved expression patterns. We also found a highly conserved region near mammalian and fish hes1 sufficient to drive expression in a specific population of IECs with active Notch signaling. These results establish a platform to define the conserved transcriptional networks underlying vertebrate IEC physiology.},

Here, to investigate how divergent transcription is reprogrammed upon stress, we measured nascent RNA synthesis at nucleotide-resolution, and profiled histone H4 acetylation in human cells. Our results globally show that the release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase into elongation functions as a critical switch at which a gene's response to stress is determined. Highly transcribed and highly inducible genes display strong transcriptional directionality and selective assembly of general transcription factors on the core sense promoter. Heat-induced transcription at enhancers, instead, correlates with prior binding of cell-type, sequence-specific transcription factors. Activated Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) binds to transcription-primed promoters and enhancers, and CTCF-occupied, non-transcribed chromatin. These results reveal chromatin architectural features that orient transcription at divergent regulatory elements and prime transcriptional responses genome-wide. Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is a regulator of stress-induced transcription. Here, the authors investigate changes to transcription and chromatin organization upon stress and find that activated HSF1 binds to transcription-primed promoters and enhancers, and to CTCF occupied, untranscribed chromatin.},

  abstract = {Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, results from aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Although most cases of BCC are sporadic, some forms are inherited, such as Bazex\textendash{}Dupr{\'e}\textendash{}Christol syndrome (BDCS)\textemdash{}a cancer-prone genodermatosis with an X-linked, dominant inheritance pattern. We have identified mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, which encodes actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), in two of the six families with BDCS that were examined in this study. High-throughput sequencing in the four remaining families identified germline mutations in noncoding sequences surrounding ACTRT1. These mutations were located in transcribed sequences encoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and were shown to impair enhancer activity and ACTRT1 expression. ARP-T1 was found to directly bind to the GLI1 promoter, thus inhibiting GLI1 expression, and loss of ARP-T1 led to activation of the Hedgehog pathway in individuals with BDCS. Moreover, exogenous expression of ACTRT1 reduced the in vitro and in vivo proliferation rates of cell lines with aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In summary, our study identifies a disease mechanism in BCC involving mutations in regulatory noncoding elements and uncovers the tumor-suppressor properties of ACTRT1.},

  abstract = {The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to enhancers, non-coding elements that shape cell-type-specific transcriptional programs and responses to extracellular cues. Systematic mapping of functional enhancers and their biological contexts is required to understand the mechanisms by which variation in non-coding genetic sequences contributes to disease. Functional enhancers can be mapped by genomic sequence disruption, but this approach is limited to the subset of enhancers that are necessary in the particular cellular context being studied. We hypothesized that recruitment of a strong transcriptional activator to an enhancer would be sufficient to drive target gene expression, even if that enhancer was not currently active in the assayed cells. Here we describe a discovery platform that can identify stimulus-responsive enhancers for a target gene independent of stimulus exposure. We used tiled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to synthetically recruit a transcriptional activator to sites across large genomic regions (more than 100 kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, CD69 and IL2RA. We identified several CRISPRa-responsive elements with chromatin features of stimulus-responsive enhancers, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbours an autoimmunity risk variant. Using engineered mouse models, we found that sequence perturbation of the disease-associated Il2ra enhancer did not entirely block Il2ra expression, but rather delayed the timing of gene activation in response to specific extracellular signals. Enhancer deletion skewed polarization of naive T cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper (TH17) cell state and away from a regulatory T cell state. This integrated approach identifies functional enhancers and reveals how non-coding variation associated with human immune dysfunction alters context-specific gene programs.},

To separate the genes potentially causally involved in pathogenesis from those likely to be secondary to the hyperglycemia we exposed islets from human donors to normal or high glucose concentrations for 24 hours and analyzed gene expression. We compared these findings with gene expression in islets from donors with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and hyperglycemia (HG, including T2D). The genes whose expression changed in the same direction after short-term glucose exposure as in T2D were considered most likely to be a consequence of hyperglycemia. Genes whose expression changed in HG but not after short-term glucose exposure, in particular genes that also correlated with insulin secretion, were considered the strongest candidates for causal involvement in T2D. E.g. ERO1LB, DOCK10, IGSF11 and PRR14L were down-regulated in HG and correlated positively with insulin secretion suggesting a protective role while TMEM132C was up-regulated in HG and correlated negatively with insulin secretion suggesting a potential pathogenic role.

  abstract = {Chromatin-based functional genomic analyses and genomewide association studies (GWASs) together implicate enhancers as critical elements influencing gene expression and risk for common diseases. Here, we performed systematic chromatin and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended ({$\geq$}3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type\textendash{}specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell culture experiments and in transgenic mice. These results suggest that stretch enhancers are critical chromatin elements for coordinating cell type\textendash{}specific regulatory programs and that sequence variation in stretch enhancers affects risk of major common human diseases.},

To edit the epigenome we developed the FIRE-Cas9 system for rapid and reversible recruitment of endogenous chromatin regulators to specific genomic loci. We enhanced the dCas9\textendash{}MS2 anchor for genome targeting with Fkbp/Frb dimerizing fusion proteins to allow chemical-induced proximity of a desired chromatin regulator. We find that mSWI/SNF (BAF) complex recruitment is sufficient to oppose Polycomb within minutes, leading to activation of bivalent gene transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, Hp1/Suv39h1 heterochromatin complex recruitment to active promoters deposits H3K9me3 domains, resulting in gene silencing that can be reversed upon washout of the chemical dimerizer. This inducible recruitment strategy provides precise kinetic information to model epigenetic memory and plasticity. It is broadly applicable to mechanistic studies of chromatin in mammalian cells and is particularly suited to the analysis of endogenous multi-subunit chromatin regulator complexes. Understanding the link between epigenetic marks and gene regulation requires the development of new tools to directly manipulate chromatin. Here the authors demonstrate a Cas9-based system to recruit chromatin remodelers to loci of interest, allowing rapid, reversible manipulation of epigenetic states.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Enhancers are transcription factor platforms that also bind RNA polymerase II and generate enhancer RNAs (eRNA). Although eRNAs have been suggested as predictors of enhancer activities and possibly key components facilitating transcription, there is little genetic evidence to support this. We address the biology of eRNAs in vivo and investigate eRNA patterns, expression levels and possible functions within a mammary-specific super-enhancer that is composed of three units with distinct transcriptional capacities. We show that eRNA levels do not correspond with the activities of their respective enhancer units. However, changes in eRNA expression upon deletion of individual enhancer units reflect the change in overall super-enhancer activity. These data provide genetic evidence that eRNA levels are not a reliable readout of individual enhancers, but they predict super-enhancer activity in the absence of constituent elements.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

I describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic elements that are enriched with or depleted of loci influencing a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged from around 2\% (for platelet volume) up to around 20\% (for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting each GWAS by using information from functional genomics increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5\%.},

However, it is generally the case that GWAS risk variants are not themselves causally affecting the trait, but rather, are correlated to the true causal variant through linkage disequilibrium (LD). Plausible causal variants are identified in fine-mapping studies through targeted sequencing followed by prioritization of variants for functional validation. In this work, we propose methods that leverage two sources of independent information, the association strength and genomic functional location, to prioritize causal variants. We demonstrate in simulations and empirical data that our approach reduces the number of SNPs that need to be selected for follow-up to identify the true causal variants at GWAS risk loci.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many complex loci. However, most loci reside in noncoding regions and have unknown biological functions. Integrative analysis that incorporates known functional information into GWASs can help elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and prioritize important functional variants. Hence, we develop a flexible Bayesian variable selection model with efficient computational techniques for such integrative analysis. Different from previous approaches, our method models the effect-size distribution and probability of causality for variants with different annotations and jointly models genome-wide variants to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD), thus prioritizing associations based on the quantification of the annotations and allowing for multiple associated variants per locus. Our method dramatically improves both computational speed and posterior sampling convergence by taking advantage of the block-wise LD structures in human genomes. In simulations, our method accurately quantifies the functional enrichment and performs more powerfully for prioritizing the true associations than alternative methods, where the power gain is especially apparent when multiple associated variants in LD reside in the same locus. We applied our method to an in-depth GWAS of age-related macular degeneration with 33,976 individuals and 9,857,286 variants. We find the strongest enrichment for causality among non-synonymous variants (54\texttimes{} more likely to be causal, 1.4\texttimes{} larger effect sizes) and variants in transcription, repressed Polycomb, and enhancer regions, as well as identify five additional candidate loci beyond the 32 known AMD risk loci. In conclusion, our method is shown to efficiently integrate functional information in GWASs, helping identify functional associated-variants and underlying biology.},

Many experimental efforts have been dedicated to mapping regulatory regions in the genome but there are not many systematic methods that integrate functional data and regulatory sequences to predict the potential effect of any genetic variant on any given tissue and motif. Here we present a tissue and factor specific annotation that provides a predicted functional effect for both common and rare genetic variants. These predictions, certain of which are validated experimentally, show that the majority of genetic variants in gene regulatory regions are actually silent. Annotating those that are not silent allows us to investigate the molecular basis for the genetic architecture of many common traits and also to study the evolutionary properties that different types of regulatory sequences have across tissues or transcription factors. Overall, our study supports the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites for distinct classes of transcription factors has been a major target of evolutionary forces contributing to disease risk and complex trait variation in humans.},

Promising association signals were followed-up in additional data sets (of 14,545 or 7,397 T2D cases and 38,994 or 71,604 controls). We identified 13 novel T2D-associated loci (p{$<$}5\texttimes{}10-8), including variants near the GLP2R, GIP, and HLA-DQA1 genes. Our analysis brought the total number of independent T2D associations to 128 distinct signals at 113 loci. Despite substantially increased sample size and more complete coverage of low-frequency variation, all novel associations were driven by common SNVs. Credible sets of potentially causal variants were generally larger than those based on imputation with earlier reference panels, consistent with resolution of causal signals to common risk haplotypes. Stratification of T2D-associated loci based on T2D-related quantitative trait associations revealed tissue-specific enrichment of regulatory annotations in pancreatic islet enhancers for loci influencing insulin secretion, and in adipocytes, monocytes and hepatocytes for insulin action-associated loci. These findings highlight the predominant role played by common variants of modest effect and the diversity of biological mechanisms influencing T2D pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Noncoding regulatory variants are often highly context-specific, modulating gene expression in a small subset of possible cellular states. Although these genetic effects are likely to play important roles in disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying context-specificity are not well understood. Here, we identify shared quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chromatin accessibility and gene expression (eQTLs) and show that a large fraction (\textasciitilde{}60\%) of eQTLs that appear following macrophage immune stimulation alter chromatin accessibility in unstimulated cells, suggesting they perturb enhancer priming. We show that such variants are likely to influence the binding of cell type specific transcription factors (TFs), such as PU.1, which then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific TFs, such as NF-{$\kappa$}B or STAT2. Our results imply that, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine mapping causal noncoding variants, detecting their downstream impact on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and timepoints.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified {$>$}100 independent SNPs that modulate the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of most of these SNPs remain elusive. Here, we examined genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiles in human pancreatic islets to understand the links between genetic variation, chromatin landscape, and gene expression in the context of T2D. We first integrated genome and transcriptome variation across 112 islet samples to produce dense cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) maps. Additional integration with chromatin-state maps for islets and other diverse tissue types revealed that cis-eQTLs for islet-specific genes are specifically and significantly enriched in islet stretch enhancers. High-resolution chromatin accessibility profiling using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) in two islet samples enabled us to identify specific transcription factor (TF) footprints embedded in active regulatory elements, which are highly enriched for islet cis-eQTL. Aggregate allelic bias signatures in TF footprints enabled us de novo to reconstruct TF binding affinities genetically, which support the high-quality nature of the TF footprint predictions. Interestingly, we found that T2D GWAS loci were strikingly and specifically enriched in islet Regulatory Factor X (RFX) footprints. Remarkably, within and across independent loci, T2D risk alleles that overlap with RFX footprints uniformly disrupt the RFX motifs at high-information content positions. Together, these results suggest that common regulatory variations have shaped islet TF footprints and the transcriptome and that a confluent RFX regulatory grammar plays a significant role in the genetic component of T2D predisposition.},

  abstract = {Gene-by-environment interactions (GxE) determine common disease risk factors and biomedically relevant complex traits. However, quantifying how the environment modulates genetic effects on human quantitative phenotypes presents unique challenges. Environmental covariates are complex and difficult to measure and control at the organismal level, as found in GWAS and epidemiological studies. An alternative approach focuses on the cellular environment using in vitro treatments as a proxy for the organismal environment. These cellular environments simplify the organism-level environmental exposures to provide a tractable influence on sub-cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies identified GxE in response to drug treatment and pathogen exposure. However, eQTL mapping approaches are infeasible for large scale analysis of multiple cellular environments. Recently, allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis emerged as a powerful tool to identify GxE in gene expression patterns by exploiting naturally-occurring environmental exposures. Here we characterized genetic effects on the transcriptional response to 50 treatments in 5 cell types. We discovered 1,455 genes with allele-specific expression (ASE) (FDR{$<$}10\%) and 215 genes with GxE. We demonstrated a major role for GxE in complex traits. Genes with a transcriptional response to environmental perturbations showed a 7-fold higher odds of being found in GWAS. Additionally, 105 genes that indicated GxE (49\%) were identified by GWAS as associated with complex traits. Examples include GIPR-caffeine interaction and obesity, and LAMP3-selenium interaction and Parkinson disease. Our results demonstrate that comprehensive catalogs of GxE interactions are indispensable to thoroughly annotate genes and bridge epidemiological and genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic gene transcription is regulated at many steps, including RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment, transcription initiation, promoter-proximal Pol II pause release, and transcription termination; however, mechanisms regulating transcription during productive elongation remain poorly understood. Enhancers, which activate gene transcription, themselves undergo Pol II-mediated transcription, but our understanding of enhancer transcription and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) remains incomplete. Here we show that transcription at intragenic enhancers interferes with and attenuates host gene transcription during productive elongation. While the extent of attenuation correlates positively with nascent eRNA expression, the act of intragenic enhancer transcription alone, but not eRNAs, explains the attenuation. Through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletions, we demonstrate a physiological role for intragenic enhancer-mediated transcription attenuation in cell fate determination. We propose that intragenic enhancers not only enhance transcription of one or more genes from a distance but also fine-tune transcription of their host gene through transcription interference, facilitating differential utilization of the same regulatory element for disparate functions.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are critical for maintaining cell-type\textendash{}specific gene expression and driving cell fate changes during development. Highly transcribed genes are often associated with a cluster of individual enhancers such as those found in locus control regions. Recently, these have been termed stretch enhancers or super-enhancers, which have been predicted to regulate critical cell identity genes. We employed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion approach to study the function of several enhancer clusters (ECs) and isolated enhancers in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Our results reveal that the effect of deleting ECs, also classified as ES cell super-enhancers, is highly variable, resulting in target gene expression reductions ranging from 12\% to as much as 92\%. Partial deletions of these ECs which removed only one enhancer or a subcluster of enhancers revealed partially redundant control of the regulated gene by multiple enhancers within the larger cluster. Many highly transcribed genes in ES cells are not associated with a super-enhancer; furthermore, super-enhancer predictions ignore 81\% of the potentially active regulatory elements predicted by cobinding of five or more pluripotency-associated transcription factors. Deletion of these additional enhancer regions revealed their robust regulatory role in gene transcription. In addition, select super-enhancers and enhancers were identified that regulated clusters of paralogous genes. We conclude that, whereas robust transcriptional output can be achieved by an isolated enhancer, clusters of enhancers acting on a common target gene act in a partially redundant manner to fine tune transcriptional output of their target genes.},

We also provide our perspective regarding the proposition that super-enhancers are a regulatory entity conceptually distinct from what was known before the introduction of the term. Our opinion is that there is not yet strong evidence that super-enhancers are a novel paradigm in gene regulation and that use of the term in this context is not currently justified. However, the term likely identifies strong enhancers that exhibit behaviors consistent with previous models and concepts of transcriptional regulation. In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification.

ChIP-seq analysis for the master regulator STAT5A, the glucocorticoid receptor, H3K27ac and MED1 identified 440 mammary-specific super-enhancers, half of which were associated with genes activated during pregnancy. We interrogated the Wap super-enhancer, generating mice carrying mutations in STAT5-binding sites within its constituent enhancers. Individually, the most distal site displayed the greatest enhancer activity. However, combinatorial mutation analysis showed that the 1,000-fold induction in gene expression during pregnancy relied on all enhancers. Disabling the binding sites of STAT5, NFIB and ELF5 in the proximal enhancer incapacitated the entire super-enhancer. Altogether, these data suggest a temporal and functional enhancer hierarchy.

The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed ``bivalent domains,'' consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

  abstract = {Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant paediatric brain tumour, often inflicting devastating consequences on the developing child. Genomic studies have revealed four distinct molecular subgroups with divergent biology and clinical behaviour. An understanding of the regulatory circuitry governing the transcriptional landscapes of medulloblastoma subgroups, and how this relates to their respective developmental origins, is lacking. Here, using H3K27ac and BRD4 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with tissue-matched DNA methylation and transcriptome data, we describe the active cis-regulatory landscape across 28 primary medulloblastoma specimens. Analysis of differentially regulated enhancers and super-enhancers reinforced inter-subgroup heterogeneity and revealed novel, clinically relevant insights into medulloblastoma biology. Computational reconstruction of core regulatory circuitry identified a master set of transcription factors, validated by ChIP-seq, that is responsible for subgroup divergence, and implicates candidate cells of origin for Group 4. Our integrated analysis of enhancer elements in a large series of primary tumour samples reveals insights into cis-regulatory architecture, unrecognized dependencies, and cellular origins.},

Recent studies suggest that key genes regulating cell type-specific functions reside in enhancer-dense genomic regions (i.e., super enhancers, stretch enhancers). Here we report that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified by global nuclear run-on sequencing are extensively transcribed within super enhancers and are dynamically regulated in response to cellular signaling. Using Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages as a model system, we find that transcription of super enhancer-associated eRNAs is dynamically induced at most of the key genes driving innate immunity and inflammation. Unexpectedly, genes repressed by TLR4 signaling are also associated with super enhancer domains and accompanied by massive repression of eRNA transcription. Furthermore, we find each super enhancer acts as a single regulatory unit within which eRNA and genic transcripts are coordinately regulated. The key regulatory activity of these domains is further supported by the finding that super enhancer-associated transcription factor binding is twice as likely to be conserved between human and mouse than typical enhancer sites. Our study suggests that transcriptional activities at super enhancers are critical components to understand the dynamic gene regulatory network.},

  abstract = {Summary
Super-enhancers are tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements that drive expression of genes associated with cell identity and malignancy. A cardinal feature of super-enhancers is that they are transcribed to produce enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). It remains unclear whether super-enhancers robustly activate genes in~situ and whether their functions are attributable to eRNAs or the DNA element. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to systematically delete three discrete super-enhancers at the Nanog locus in embryonic stem cells, revealing functional differences in Nanog transcriptional regulation. One distal super-enhancer 45~kb upstream of Nanog (-45 enhancer) regulates both nearest neighbor genes, Nanog and Dppa3. Interestingly, eRNAs produced at the -45 enhancer specifically regulate Dppa3 expression by stabilizing looping of the -45 enhancer and Dppa3. Our work illustrates that genomic editing is required to determine enhancer function and points to a method to selectively target a subset of super-enhancer-regulated genes by depleting eRNAs.},

Cancer cells frequently acquire SEs at genes that promote tumorigenesis, and we show that these genes are especially sensitive to perturbation of oncogenic signaling pathways.

Following injury, culture or transplantation, stem cells outside their niche often display fate flexibility. Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. Using hair follicle as a model, we map the global chromatin domains of hair follicle stem cells and their committed progenitors in their native microenvironments. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters (/`epicentres/') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. We further show that when outside their niche, either in vitro or in wound-repair, hair follicle stem cells dynamically remodel super-enhancers in response to changes in their microenvironment. Intriguingly, some key super-enhancers shift epicentres, enabling their genes to remain active and maintain a transitional state in an ever-changing transcriptional landscape. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.},

By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and four hESC-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that while topological domain boundaries remain intact during differentiation, interactions both within and between domains change dramatically, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal ``compartments'' throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome datasets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.},

Differentiating mouse and human ESCs increase genome-wide acetylation (euchromatic) and tri-methylation (heterochromatic) of lysine 9 on histone H3. The Oct4 locus is euchromatic when expressed in undifferentiated ESCs and heterochromatic after differentiation. Brachyury T, a mesoderm-specific transcription factor, is not yet expressed in undifferentiated cells, where its locus has ``bivalent'' tri-methyl lysine 4 and lysine 27 modifications. During directed differentiation to pre-cardiac mesoderm, the activated brachyury locus has high levels of tri-methyl lysine 4 (euchromatin), switching to heterochromatin after gene silencing. Thus, ESC differentiation is accompanied by genome-wide commitment to euchromatin or heterochromatin. Undifferentiated hESCs bivalently modify the brachyury locus, activate it to euchromatin during mesoderm induction, and subsequently repress it to heterochromatin, demonstrating, to our knowledge, the first analysis of chromatin dynamics at a locus essential for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.

As cells develop and differentiate into different types, the shape and accessibility of their DNA can change. Lara-Astiaso et al. studied this phenomenon in blood. They developed a technique that examines a relatively small number of cells to identify the changes that affect DNA during blood development. They found that the DNA of noncoding regions, called enhancers, is set in an open position when cells are undifferentiated and able to take on a variety of roles and gradually closes as cells mature into their final forms.
Science, this issue p. 943
Chromatin modifications are crucial for development, yet little is known about their dynamics during differentiation. Hematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study chromatin state dynamics; however, technical limitations impede profiling of homogeneous differentiation intermediates. We developed a high-sensitivity indexing-first chromatin immunoprecipitation approach to profile the dynamics of four chromatin modifications across 16 stages of hematopoietic differentiation. We identify 48,415 enhancer regions and characterize their dynamics. We find that lineage commitment involves de novo establishment of 17,035 lineage-specific enhancers. These enhancer repertoire expansions foreshadow transcriptional programs in differentiated cells. Combining our enhancer catalog with gene expression profiles, we elucidate the transcription factor network controlling chromatin dynamics and lineage specification in hematopoiesis. Together, our results provide a comprehensive model of chromatin dynamics during development.

Regulatory elements are notoriously difficult to locate and may reside at considerable distances from the transcription units on which they operate and, moreover, may be incorporated into the structure of neighbouring genes. The importance of regulatory mutations as the basis of human abnormalities remains obscure. Here, we show that the chromosome 7q36 associated preaxial polydactyly, a frequently observed congenital limb malformation, results from point mutations in a Shh regulatory element. Shh, normally expressed in the ZPA posteriorly in the limb bud, is expressed in an additional ectopic site at the anterior margin in mouse models of PPD. Our investigations into the basis of the ectopic Shh expression identified the enhancer element that drives normal Shh expression in the ZPA. The regulator, designated ZRS, lies within intron 5 of the Lmbr1 gene 1\hspace{0.25em}Mb from the target gene Shh. The ZRS drives the early spatio-temporal expression pattern in the limb of tetrapods. Despite the morphological differences between limbs and fins, an equivalent regulatory element is found in fish. The ZRS contains point mutations that segregate with polydactyly in four unrelated families with PPD and in the Hx mouse mutant. Thus point mutations residing in long-range regulatory elements are capable of causing congenital abnormalities, and possess the capacity to modify gene activity such that a novel gamut of abnormalities is detected.},

Mammalian genomes are organized into megabase-scale topologically associated domains (TADs). We demonstrate that disruption of TADs can rewire long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. We show that distinct human limb malformations are caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications altering the structure of the TAD-spanning WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.},

We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.

  abstract = {Efficient transcription of genes requires a high local concentration of the relevant trans-acting factors. Nuclear compartmentalization can provide an effective means to locally increase the concentration of rapidly moving trans-acting factors; this may be achieved by spatial clustering of chromatin-associated binding sites for such factors1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here we analyze the structure of an erythroid-specific spatial cluster of cis-regulatory elements and active -globin genes, the active chromatin hub (ACH; ref. 6), at different stages of development and in erythroid progenitors. We show, in mice and humans, that a core ACH is developmentally conserved and consists of the hypersensitive sites (HS1-HS6) of the locus control region (LCR), the upstream 5' HS-60/-62 and downstream 3' HS1. Globin genes switch their interaction with this cluster during development, correlating with the switch in their transcriptional activity7. In mouse erythroid progenitors that are committed to but do not yet express -globin, only the interactions between 5' HS-60/-62, 3' HS1 and hypersensitive sites at the 5' side of the LCR are stably present. After induction of differentiation, these sites cluster with the rest of the LCR and the gene that is activated. We conclude that during erythroid differentiation, cis-regulatory DNA elements create a developmentally conserved nuclear compartment dedicated to RNA polymerase II transcription of -globin genes.},

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the dominant technique for mapping transcription factor (TF) binding regions genome-wide. We performed an integrative analysis centered around 457 ChIP-seq data sets on 119 human TFs generated by the ENCODE Consortium. We identified highly enriched sequence motifs in most data sets, revealing new motifs and validating known ones. The motif sites (TF binding sites) are highly conserved evolutionarily and show distinct footprints upon DNase I digestion. We frequently detected secondary motifs in addition to the canonical motifs of the TFs, indicating tethered binding and cobinding between multiple TFs. We observed significant position and orientation preferences between many cobinding TFs. Genes specifically expressed in a cell line are often associated with a greater occurrence of nearby TF binding in that cell line. We observed cell-line\textendash{}specific secondary motifs that mediate the binding of the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the enhancer-binding protein EP300. TF binding sites are located in GC-rich, nucleosome-depleted, and DNase I sensitive regions, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes, and many of these features show cell type specificity. The GC-richness may be beneficial for regulating TF binding because, when unoccupied by a TF, these regions are occupied by nucleosomes in vivo. We present the results of our analysis in a TF-centric web repository Factorbook (http://factorbook.org) and will continually update this repository as more ENCODE data are generated.},

Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9\%) are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.},

In contrast to prior expectations, we found 102 (94\%) to be active enhancers during embryogenesis and to display diverse spatial and temporal patterns, reminiscent of expression patterns for important developmental genes. Remarkably, HOT regions strongly activate nearby genes and are required for endogenous gene expression, as we show using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. HOT enhancers have a distinct cis-regulatory signature with enriched sequence motifs for the global activators Vielfaltig, also known as Zelda, and Trithorax-like, also known as GAGA. This signature allows the prediction of HOT versus control regions from the DNA sequence alone.},

Treatment of two mouse pancreatic {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} cell lines ({$\alpha$}TC1-6 and {$\beta$}TC1) with proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{$\beta$}, IFN-{$\gamma$}, and TNF-{$\alpha$} at doses that specifically induce apoptosis of {$\beta$}TC1 significantly increased the amount of mRNA and protein encoded by Cebpa and its proapoptotic targets, Arl6ip5 and Tnfrsf10b, in {$\beta$}TC1 but not in {$\alpha$}TC1-6. Cebpa knockdown in {$\beta$}TC1 significantly decreased cytokine-induced apoptosis, together with the amount of Arl6ip5 and Tnfrsf10b. Analysis of the network comprising CEBPA, its targets, their first interactants, and proteins encoded by genes known to regulate cytokine-induced apoptosis in pancreatic {$\beta$} cells (genes from the apoptotic machinery and from MAPK and NFkB pathways) revealed that CEBPA, ARL6IP5, TNFRSF10B, TRAF2, and UBC are the top five central nodes. In silico analysis further suggests TRAF2 as trait d'union node between CEBPA and the NFkB pathway. Our results strongly suggest that Cebpa is a key regulator within the apoptotic network activated in pancreatic {$\beta$} cells during insulitis, and Arl6ip5, Tnfrsf10b, Traf2, and Ubc are key executioners of this program.},

PML-enforced RARA homodimerization allows the tighter binding of corepressors, silencing RARA target genes. In addition, homodimerization dramatically extends the spectrum of DNA-binding sites of the fusion protein compared with those of normal RARA. Yet, any contribution of these two properties of PML/RARA to differentiation arrest and immortalization of primary mouse hematopoietic progenitors was unknown. We demonstrate that dimerization-induced silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT)-enhanced binding and relaxed DNA-binding site specificity are both required for efficient immortalization. Thus, enforced RARA dimerization is critical not only for triggering transcriptional repression but also for extending the repertoire of target genes.

  issn = {0270-7306},
  abstract = {In response to environmental stress, cells induce a program of gene expression designed to remedy cellular damage or, alternatively, induce apoptosis. In this report, we explore the role of a family of protein kinases that phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) in coordinating stress gene responses. We find that expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily of basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, is induced in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or amino acid starvation by a mechanism requiring eIF2 kinases PEK (Perk or EIF2AK3) and GCN2 (EIF2AK4), respectively. Increased expression of ATF3 protein occurs early in response to stress by a mechanism requiring the related bZIP transcriptional regulator ATF4. ATF3 contributes to induction of the CHOP transcriptional factor in response to amino acid starvation, and loss of ATF3 function significantly lowers stress-induced expression of GADD34, an eIF2 protein phosphatase regulatory subunit implicated in feedback control of the eIF2 kinase stress response. Overexpression of ATF3 in mouse embryo fibroblasts partially bypasses the requirement for PEK for induction of GADD34 in response to ER stress, further supporting the idea that ATF3 functions directly or indirectly as a transcriptional activator of genes targeted by the eIF2 kinase stress pathway. These results indicate that ATF3 has an integral role in the coordinate gene expression induced by eIF2 kinases. Given that ATF3 is induced by a very large number of environmental insults, this study supports involvement of eIF2 kinases in the coordination of gene expression in response to a more diverse set of stress conditions than previously proposed.},

In all cases analyzed, the interaction involved the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor which directly contacted the C-terminal part of the high-mobility-group (HMG) domain. In particular, the C-terminal tail region behind helix 3 of the HMG domain was shown by mutagenesis to be essential for interaction and transcription factor recruitment.

  abstract = {DDIT3, also known as GADD153 or CHOP, encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor of the dimer forming C/EBP family. DDIT3 is known as a key regulator of cellular stress response, but its target genes and functions are not well characterized. Here, we applied a genome wide microarray based expression analysis to identify DDIT3 target genes and functions. By analyzing cells carrying tamoxifen inducible DDIT3 expression constructs we show distinct gene expression profiles for cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear localized DDIT3. Of 175 target genes identified only 3 were regulated by DDIT3 in both cellular localizations. More than two thirds of the genes were downregulated, supporting a role for DDIT3 as a dominant negative factor that could act by either cytoplasmic or nuclear sequestration of dimer forming transcription factor partners. Functional annotation of target genes showed cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis/survival as the most affected categories. Cytoplasmic DDIT3 affected more migration associated genes, while nuclear DDIT3 regulated more cell cycle controlling genes. Cell culture experiments confirmed that cytoplasmic DDIT3 inhibited migration, while nuclear DDIT3 caused a G1 cell cycle arrest. Promoters of target genes showed no common sequence motifs, reflecting that DDIT3 forms heterodimers with several alternative transcription factors that bind to different motifs. We conclude that expression of cytoplasmic DDIT3 regulated 94 genes. Nuclear translocation of DDIT3 regulated 81 additional genes linked to functions already affected by cytoplasmic DDIT3. Characterization of DDIT3 regulated functions helps understanding its role in stress response and involvement in cancer and degenerative disorders.},

  abstract = {The pharmacoepigenome can be defined as the active, noncoding province of the genome including canonical spatial and temporal regulatory mechanisms of gene regulation that respond to xenobiotic stimuli. Many psychotropic drugs that have been in clinical use for decades have ill-defined mechanisms of action that are beginning to be resolved as we understand the transcriptional hierarchy and dynamics of the nucleus. In this review, we describe spatial, temporal and biomechanical mechanisms mediated by psychotropic medications. Focus is placed on a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used both for detection of pharmacoepigenomic variants that discretize drug response and adverse events to improve pharmacogenomic testing, and for the discovery of novel CNS therapeutics. This approach integrates the functional topology and dynamics of the transcriptional hierarchy of the pharmacoepigenome, gene variant-driven identification of pharmacogenomic regulatory domains, and mesoscale mapping for the discovery of novel CNS pharmacodynamic pathways in human brain. Examples of the application of this pipeline are provided, including the discovery of valproic acid (VPA) mediated transcriptional reprogramming of neuronal cell fate following injury, and mapping of a CNS pathway glutamatergic pathway for the mood stabilizer lithium. These examples in regulatory pharmacoepigenomics illustrate how ongoing research using the 4D nucleome provides a foundation to further insight into previously unrecognized psychotropic drug pharmacodynamic pathways in the human CNS.},

  abstract = {Cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP) is a secreted protein expressed by chondrocytes; the expression is repressed by interleukin 1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}). To investigate the transcriptional mechanism, by which CD-RAP expression is suppressed by IL-1{$\beta$}, deletion constructs of the mouse CD-RAP promoter were transfected into rat chondrocytes treated with or without IL-1{$\beta$}. The results revealed an IL-1{$\beta$}-responsive element located between -2138 and -2068 bp. As this element contains a CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) motif, the function of C/EBP{$\beta$} and C/EBP{$\delta$} was examined. IL-1{$\beta$} stimulated the expression of C/EBP{$\beta$} and -{$\delta$}, and the direct binding of C/EBP{$\beta$} to the C/EBP motif was confirmed. The -2251-bp CD-RAP promoter activity was down-regulated by co-transfection with C/EBP expression vectors. Mutation of the C/EBP motif abolished the inhibitory response to IL-1{$\beta$}. Additionally, C/EBP expression vectors were found to down-regulate the construct containing the promoter and enhancer of the type II collagen gene. Finally, the enhancer factor, Sox9, was shown to bind adjacent to the C/EBP site competing with C/EBP binding. Taken together, these results suggest that C/EBP{$\beta$} and -{$\delta$} may play an important role in the IL-1{$\beta$}-induced repression of cartilage-specific proteins and that expression of matrix proteins will be influenced by the availability of positive and negativetrans-acting factors.},

  abstract = {Islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP/G6PC2) is a major autoantigen in both mouse and human type 1 diabetes. IGRP is selectively expressed in islet beta cells and polymorphisms in the IGRP gene have recently been associated with variations in fasting blood glucose levels and cardiovascular-associated mortality in humans. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have shown that the IGRP promoter binds the islet-enriched transcription factors Pax-6 and BETA2. We show here, again using ChIP assays, that the IGRP promoter also binds the islet-enriched transcription factors MafA and Foxa2. Single binding sites for these factors were identified in the proximal IGRP promoter, mutation of which resulted in decreased IGRP fusion gene expression in {$\beta$}TC-3, HIT and Min6 cells. ChiP assays have shown that the islet-enriched transcription factor Pdx-1 also binds the IGRP promoter but mutational analysis of four Pdx-1 binding sites in the proximal IGRP promoter revealed surprisingly little effect of Pdx-1 binding on IGRP fusion gene expression in {$\beta$}TC-3 cells. In contrast, in both HIT and Min6 cells mutation of these four Pdx-1 binding sites resulted in an \textasciitilde{}50\% reduction in fusion gene expression. These data suggest that the same group of islet-enriched transcription factors, namely Pdx-1, Pax-6, MafA, BETA2 and Foxa2 directly or indirectly regulate expression of the two major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes.},

Here, we report transcriptome profiling of human endoderm and pancreatic cell lineages using purified cell populations. Analysis of the data sets allows us to identify hundreds of lncRNAs that exhibit differentiation-stage-specific expression patterns. As a first step in characterizing these lncRNAs, we focus on an endoderm-specific lncRNA, definitive~endoderm-associated lncRNA1 (DEANR1), and demonstrate that it plays an important role in human endoderm differentiation. DEANR1 contributes to endoderm differentiation by positively regulating expression of the endoderm factor FOXA2. Importantly, overexpression of FOXA2 is able to rescue endoderm differentiation defects caused by~DEANR1 depletion. Mechanistically, DEANR1 facilitates FOXA2 activation by facilitating SMAD2/3 recruitment to the FOXA2 promoter. Thus, our study~not only reveals a large set of differentiation-stage-specific lncRNAs but also characterizes a functional lncRNA that is important for endoderm differentiation.},

  abstract = {The regulation of fat and glucose metabolism in the liver is controlled primarily by insulin and glucagon. Changes in the circulating concentrations of these hormones signal fed or starvation states and elicit counter-regulatory responses that maintain normoglycaemia. Here we show that in normal mice, plasma insulin inhibits the forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 by nuclear exclusion and that in the fasted (low insulin) state Foxa2 activates transcriptional programmes of lipid metabolism and ketogenesis. In insulin-resistant or hyperinsulinaemic mice, Foxa2 is inactive and permanently located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In these mice, adenoviral expression of Foxa2T156A, a nuclear, constitutively active Foxa2 that cannot be inhibited by insulin, decreases hepatic triglyceride content, increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, reduces glucose production, normalizes plasma glucose and significantly lowers plasma insulin. These changes are associated with increased expression of genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and glycolysis. Chronic hyperinsulinaemia in insulin-resistant syndromes results in the cytoplasmic localization and inactivation of Foxa2, thereby promoting lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in the liver. Pharmacological intervention to inhibit phosphorylation of Foxa2 may be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor Foxa2 is implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. Conditional expression of Foxa2 or its dominant-negative mutant DN-Foxa2 in INS-1 cells reveals that Foxa2 regulates the expression of genes important for glucose sensing in pancreatic {$\beta$}-cells. Overexpression of Foxa2 results in blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 causes a left shift of glucose-induced insulin release. The mRNA levels of GLUT2 and glucokinase are drastically decreased after induction of Foxa2. In contrast, loss of Foxa2 function leads to up-regulation of hexokinase (HK) I and II and glucokinase (HK-IV) mRNA expression. The glucokinase and the low K mhexokinase activities as well as glycolysis are increased proportionally. In addition, induction of DN-Foxa2 also reduces the expression of {$\beta$}-cell KATP channel subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 by 70\%. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, induction of Foxa2 causes pronounced decreases in the HNF4{$\alpha$} and HNF1{$\alpha$} mRNA levels. Foxa2 fails to regulate the expression of Pdx1 transcripts. The expression of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide is markedly suppressed after induction of Foxa2, while the glucagon mRNA levels are significantly increased. Conversely, Foxa2 is required for glucagon expression in these INS-1-derived cells. These results suggest that Foxa2 is a vital transcription factor evolved to control the expression of genes essential for maintaining {$\beta$}-cell glucose sensing and glucose homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Bisulfite sequencing is widely employed to study the role of DNA methylation in disease; however, the data suffer from biases due to variability in depth of coverage. Imputation of methylation values at low-coverage sites may mitigate these biases while also identifying important genomic features and motifs associated with predictive power. Here we describe BoostMe, a novel method for imputation of DNA methylation within whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data based on a gradient boosting algorithm. Importantly, we designed a new feature that leverages information from multiple samples in the same tissue and disease state, enabling BoostMe to outperform existing imputation methods in speed and accuracy. We show that imputation improves WGBS concordance with the Infinium MethylationEPIC array at low WGBS sequencing depth, suggesting improvement in WGBS accuracy after imputation. Furthermore, we compare the ability of BoostMe and DeepCpG - a deep neural network method - to identify interesting features and motifs associated with methylation in three human tissues implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D) etiology. We find that while BoostMe only identifies features important to general methylation levels across tissues, DeepCpG is able to learn differences in methylation-associated sequence motifs among different tissues and identify tissue-specific regulators of differentiation such as EBF1 in adipose, ASCL2 in muscle, and FOXA1, TCF12, and NRF1 in islets. Neither algorithm readily identified T2D-associated features. Our findings demonstrate the current power and limitations of machine and deep learning algorithms to both improve the quality of, and infer biological meaning from, genome-wide DNA methylation data.},

Despite their key role as physiological regulators and widely administered pharmaceuticals, little is known about the genetic basis of inter-individual and inter-ethnic variation in GC response. As GC action is mediated by the regulation of gene expression, we profiled transcript abundance and protein secretion in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes from a panel of 114 individuals, including those of both African and European ancestry. Combining these molecular traits with genome-wide genetic data, we found that genotype-treatment interactions at polymorphisms near genes affected GC regulation of expression for 26 genes and of secretion for IL6. A novel statistical approach revealed that these interactions could be distinguished into distinct types, with some showing genotypic effects only in GC-treated samples and others showing genotypic effects only in control-treated samples, with differing phenotypic and molecular interpretations. The insights into the genetic basis of variation in GC response and the statistical tools for identifying gene-treatment interactions that we provide will aid future efforts to identify genetic predictors of response to this and other treatments.},

  abstract = {Author summary Most complex traits and diseases are regulated by the combined influence of multiple genetic variants. However, it remains controversial whether these genetic variants independently influence complex traits, and therefore the impact of each variant could be simply added together (additivity), or whether the variants work together to influence trait variation, in which case the combined impact of multiple variants would differ from the summed impact of each individual variant (epistasis). In this study in mice, we discovered that the genetic regulation of blood sugar levels and gene expression in the liver were predominantly controlled by non-additive interactions, whereas body weight was predominantly controlled by additive interactions. Remarkably, the expression level of nearly 25\% of all genes in the liver was controlled by non-additive interactions. The non-additive interactions typically acted to return trait values to the levels detected in control mice, thus contributing to a reduction in trait variation. We also demonstrated that not accounting for non-additive interactions significantly underestimated the phenotypic effect of a genetic variant on a particular genetic background, suggesting that many previously identified risk loci may have significantly larger effects on disease susceptibility in a subset of individuals. These studies highlight the importance of understanding interactions between genetic variants to better understand disease risk and personalize clinical care.},

Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of ADCY5, a gene that encodes adenylate cyclase 5. Adenylate cyclase 5 catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic {$\beta$}-cell insulin secretion. We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased ADCY5 expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function. rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets. The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer H3K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent {$\beta$}-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele. Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64\% reduction in expression level of Adcy5, but not adjacent gene Sec22a, and a 39\% reduction in insulin secretion. Together, these data suggest that rs11708067-A risk allele contributes to type 2 diabetes by disrupting an islet enhancer, which results in reduced ADCY5 expression and impaired insulin secretion.},

  abstract = {Author summary Where a gene's regulatory site is disrupted by a genetic variant, its expression levels will vary between individuals depending on the version of the variant they carry. Such genetic loci, termed eQTLs, have been found to be disproportionately associated with disease and have proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the location of regulatory variation in the human genome. Despite the widespread study of eQTLs, the focus has, to date, largely been on the effect of individual variants on individual genes. The extent to which individual variants are linked to the expression of multiple nearby genes (suggestive of such variants tagging shared regulatory sites) is largely unknown. By first removing redundancy among eQTLs and then examining their effects across tissues and how they relate to how the genome folds, we show that cis-eQTL sharing is a relatively common phenomenon. We show that these master-eQTLs are not only linked to the way in which the human genome has evolved, but are also relevant to the understanding of the co-occurrence of diseases in individuals. These variants are more often linked to multiple diseases and phenotypes, which suggests that these locations are key hubs for understanding human disease risk.},

  abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P {$<$} 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10\% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16\% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20\% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

  abstract = {Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) implicate the PHACTR1 locus (6p24) in risk for five vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, migraine headache, cervical artery dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension. Through genetic fine mapping, we prioritized rs9349379, a common SNP in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, as the putative causal variant. Epigenomic data from human tissue revealed an enhancer signature at rs9349379 exclusively in aorta, suggesting a regulatory function for~this SNP in the vasculature. CRISPR-edited stem cell-derived endothelial cells demonstrate rs9349379 regulates expression of endothelin 1 (EDN1), a gene located 600 kb upstream of PHACTR1. The known physiologic effects of EDN1 on the vasculature may explain the pattern of risk for the five associated diseases. Overall, these data illustrate the integration of genetic, phenotypic, and epigenetic analysis to identify the biologic mechanism by which a common, non-coding variant can distally regulate a gene and contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple vascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Identifying the genetic basis of complex traits is an important problem with the potential to impact a broad range of biological endeavors. A number of effective statistical methods are available for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping that allow for the efficient identification of multiple, potentially interacting, loci under a variety of experimental conditions. Although proven useful in hundreds of studies, the majority of these methods assumes a single model common to each subject, which may reduce power and accuracy when genetically distinct subclasses exist. To address this, we have developed an approach to enable latent class QTL mapping. The approach combines latent class regression with stepwise variable selection and traditional QTL mapping to estimate the number of subclasses in a population, and to identify the genetic model that best describes each subclass. Simulations demonstrate good performance of the method when latent classes are present as well as when they are not, with accurate estimation of QTL. Application of the method to case studies of obesity and diabetes in mouse gives insight into the genetic basis of related complex traits.},

  abstract = {Lipids have been implicated in {$\beta$}-cell stimulus\textendash{}secretion coupling. In such a role, lipases in {$\beta$}-cells would be required to generate lipid coupling factors. We have shown previously that glucose stimulates lipolysis in rodent islets. In addition, lipolysis and diacylglycerol lipase activity in islets are abolished by orlistat, an irreversible lipase inhibitor with a broad specificity for substrates. Moreover, orlistat dose-dependently inhibits glucose- and forskolin-stimulated insulin secretion, while leaving glucose oxidation and the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio intact. In an effort to identify {$\beta$}-cell lipase(s), we found that HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), the rate-limiting enzyme for acylglycerol hydrolysis in adipocytes, is expressed in rodent {$\beta$}-cells. To resolve the role of this lipase, we have created global and {$\beta$}-cell-specific knockout mice. Although our line of global HSL-knockout mice is moderately glucose-intolerant owing to reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity and exhibits normal islet metabolism and insulin secretion, other HSL-knockout lines have displayed impaired insulin secretion under certain conditions. In contrast, {$\beta$}-cell-specific HSL-knockout mice, which are less prone to genetic redundancy, are hyperglycaemic, presumably caused by a perturbation of first-phase insulin secretion. Thus studies by us and others demonstrate that lipases, such as HSL, play a regulatory role in {$\beta$}-cell stimulus\textendash{}secretion coupling.},

We investigated DGK isoform mRNA expression in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscle, liver as well as subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissue in C57BL/6J mice and obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. All DGK isoforms, except for DGK{$\kappa$}, were detectable, although with varying mRNA expression. Liver DGK expression was generally lowest, with several isoforms undetectable. In soleus muscle, subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissue, DGK{$\delta$} was the most abundant isoform. In EDL muscle, DGK{$\alpha$} and DGK{$\zeta$} were the most abundant isoforms. In liver, DGK{$\zeta$} was the most abundant isoform. Comparing obese insulin-resistant ob/ob mice to lean C57BL/6J mice, DGK{$\beta$}, DGK{$\iota$}, and DGK\texttheta{} were increased and DGK{$\epsilon$} expression was decreased in EDL muscle, while DGK{$\beta$}, DGK{$\eta$} and DGK\texttheta{} were decreased and DGK{$\delta$} and DGK{$\iota$} were increased in soleus muscle. In liver, DGK{$\delta$} and DGK{$\zeta$} expression was increased in ob/ob mice. DGK{$\eta$} was increased in subcutaneous fat, while DGK{$\zeta$} was increased and DGK{$\beta$}, DGK{$\delta$}, DGK{$\eta$} and DGK{$\epsilon$} were decreased in epididymal fat from ob/ob mice. In both adipose tissue depots, DGK{$\alpha$} and DGK{$\gamma$} were decreased and DGK{$\iota$} was increased in ob/ob mice. In conclusion, DGK mRNA expression is altered in an isoform- and tissue-dependent manner in obese insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. DGK isoforms likely have divergent functional roles in distinct tissues, which may contribute to metabolic dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Biological interpretation of GWAS data frequently involves analyzing unsigned genomic annotations comprising SNPs involved in a biological process and assessing enrichment for disease signal. However, it is often possible to generate signed annotations quantifying whether each SNP allele promotes or hinders a biological process, e.g., binding of a transcription factor (TF). Directional effects of such annotations on disease risk enable stronger statements about causal mechanisms of disease than enrichments of corresponding unsigned annotations. Here we introduce a new method, signed LD profile regression, for detecting such directional effects using GWAS summary statistics, and we apply the method using 382 signed annotations reflecting predicted TF binding. We show via theory and simulations that our method is well-powered and is well-calibrated even when TF binding sites co-localize with other enriched regulatory elements, which can confound unsigned enrichment methods. We apply our method to 12 molecular traits and recover many known relationships including positive associations between gene expression and genome-wide binding of RNA polymerase II, NF-{$\kappa$}B, and several ETS family members, as well as between known chromatin modifiers and their respective chromatin marks. Finally, we apply our method to 46 diseases and complex traits (average N=289,617) and identify 77 significant associations at per-trait FDR{$<$}5\%, representing 12 independent signals. Our results include a positive association between educational attainment and genome-wide binding of BCL11A, consistent with recent work linking BCL11A hemizygosity to intellectual disability; a negative association between lupus risk and genome-wide binding of CTCF, which has been shown to suppress myeloid differentiation; and a positive association between Crohn's disease (CD) risk and genome-wide binding of IRF1, an immune regulator that lies inside a CD GWAS locus and has eQTLs that increase CD risk. Our method provides a new way to leverage functional data to draw inferences about causal mechanisms of disease.},

What is still largely missing, however, is the understanding of the biological context in which these candidate variants act and of how they determine each trait. Given the localization of many GWAS loci outside coding regions and the important role of regulatory variation in shaping phenotypic variance, gene expression has been proposed as a plausible informative intermediate phenotype. Here we show that for a subset of the currently published GWAS this is indeed the case, by observing a significant excess of regulatory variants among disease loci. We propose an empirical methodology (regulatory trait concordance\textemdash{}RTC) able to integrate expression and disease data in order to detect causal regulatory effects. We show that the RTC outperforms simple correlation metrics under various simulated linkage disequilibrium (LD) scenarios. Our method is able to recover previously suspected causal regulatory effects from the literature and, as expected given the nature of the tested tissue, an overrepresentation of immunity-related candidates is observed. As the number of available tissues will increase, this prioritization approach will become even more useful in understanding the implication of regulatory variants in disease etiology.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual's disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present eCAVIAR, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that eCAVIAR can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found a large number of genetic regions (``loci'') affecting clinical end-points and phenotypes, many outside coding intervals. One approach to understanding the biological basis of these associations has been to explore whether GWAS signals from intermediate cellular phenotypes, in particular gene expression, are located in the same loci (``colocalise'') and are potentially mediating the disease signals. However, it is not clear how to assess whether the same variants are responsible for the two GWAS signals or whether it is distinct causal variants close to each other. In this paper, we describe a statistical method that can use simply single variant summary statistics to test for colocalisation of GWAS signals. We describe one application of our method to a meta-analysis of blood lipids and liver expression, although any two datasets resulting from association studies can be used. Our method is able to detect the subset of GWAS signals explained by regulatory effects and identify candidate genes affected by the same GWAS variants. As summary GWAS data are increasingly available, applications of colocalisation methods to integrate the findings will be essential for functional follow-up, and will also be particularly useful to identify tissue specific signals in eQTL datasets.},

To define fundamental processes leading to the diabetic state, we examined the relationship between type 2 diabetes risk variants at 37 established susceptibility loci, and indices of proinsulin processing, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. We included data from up to 58,614 nondiabetic subjects with basal measures and 17,327 with dynamic measures. We used additive genetic models with adjustment for sex, age, and BMI, followed by fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analyses. Cluster analyses grouped risk loci into five major categories based on their relationship to these continuous glycemic phenotypes. The first cluster (PPARG, KLF14, IRS1, GCKR) was characterized by primary effects on insulin sensitivity. The second cluster (MTNR1B, GCK) featured risk alleles associated with reduced insulin secretion and fasting hyperglycemia. ARAP1 constituted a third cluster characterized by defects in insulin processing. A fourth cluster (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX/IDE, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B) was defined by loci influencing insulin processing and secretion without a detectable change in fasting glucose levels. The final group contained 20 risk loci with no clear-cut associations to continuous glycemic traits. By assembling extensive data on continuous glycemic traits, we have exposed the diverse mechanisms whereby type 2 diabetes risk variants impact disease predisposition.},

Recent studies have shown that noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been associated with risk for numerous common diseases through genome-wide association studies frequently lie in cell-type-specific enhancer elements. These enhancer variants probably influence transcriptional output, thereby offering a mechanistic basis to explain their association with risk for many common diseases. This review focuses on the identification and interpretation of disease-susceptibility variants that influence enhancer function. We discuss strategies for prioritizing the study of functional enhancer SNPs over those likely to be benign, review experimental and computational approaches to identifying the gene targets of enhancer variants, and highlight efforts to quantify the impact of enhancer variants on target transcript levels and cellular phenotypes. These studies are beginning to provide insights into the mechanistic basis of many common diseases, as well as into how we might translate this knowledge for improved disease diagnosis, prevention and treatments. Finally, we highlight five major challenges often associated with interpreting enhancer variants, and discuss recent technical advances that may help to surmount these challenges.},

  abstract = {DNA variants (SNPs) that predispose to common traits often localize within noncoding regulatory elements such as enhancers. Moreover, loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often contain multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), any of which may be causal. Thus, determining the effect of these multiple variant SNPs on target transcript levels has been a major challenge. Here, we provide evidence that for six common autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and ulcerative colitis), the GWAS association arises from multiple polymorphisms in LD that map to clusters of enhancer elements active in the same cell type. This finding suggests a ``multiple enhancer variant'' hypothesis for common traits, where several variants in LD impact multiple enhancers and cooperatively affect gene expression. Using a novel method to delineate enhancer\textendash{}gene interactions, we show that multiple enhancer variants within a given locus typically target the same gene. Using available data from HapMap and B lymphoblasts as a model system, we provide evidence at numerous loci that multiple enhancer variants cooperatively contribute to altered expression of their gene targets. The effects on target transcript levels tend to be modest and can be either gain- or loss-of-function. Additionally, the genes associated with multiple enhancer variants encode proteins that are often functionally related and enriched in common pathways. Overall, the multiple enhancer variant hypothesis offers a new paradigm by which noncoding variants can confer susceptibility to common traits.},

  abstract = {Most studies of responses to transcriptional stimuli measure changes in cellular mRNA concentrations. By sequencing nascent RNA instead, it is possible to detect changes in transcription in minutes rather than hours and thereby distinguish primary from secondary responses to regulatory signals. Here, we describe the use of PRO-seq to characterize the immediate transcriptional response in human cells to celastrol, a compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine that has potent anti-inflammatory, tumor-inhibitory, and obesity-controlling effects. Celastrol is known to elicit a cellular stress response resembling the response to heat shock, but the transcriptional basis of this response remains unclear. Our analysis of PRO-seq data for K562 cells reveals dramatic transcriptional effects soon after celastrol treatment at a broad collection of both coding and noncoding transcription units. This transcriptional response occurred in two major waves, one within 10 min, and a second 40\textendash{}60 min after treatment. Transcriptional activity was generally repressed by celastrol, but one distinct group of genes, enriched for roles in the heat shock response, displayed strong activation. Using a regression approach, we identified key transcription factors that appear to drive these transcriptional responses, including members of the E2F and RFX families. We also found sequence-based evidence that particular transcription factors drive the activation of enhancers. We observed increased polymerase pausing at both genes and enhancers, suggesting that pause release may be widely inhibited during the celastrol response. Our study demonstrates that a careful analysis of PRO-seq time-course data can disentangle key aspects of a complex transcriptional response, and it provides new insights into the activity of a powerful pharmacological agent.},

  abstract = {Author summary Understanding the causal relationships between pairs of traits is crucial for unravelling the causes of disease. To this end, results from genome-wide association studies are valuable because if a trait is known to be influenced by a genetic variant then this knowledge can be used to test the trait's causal influences on other traits and diseases. Here we discuss scenarios where the nature of the genetic association with the causal trait can lead existing causal inference methods to give the wrong direction of causality. We introduce a new method that can be applied to summary level data and is potentially less susceptible to problems such as measurement error, and apply it to evaluate the causal relationships between DNA methylation levels and gene expression. While our results show that DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, we point out that is it crucial to acknowledge that systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms could influence such conclusions.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants that modulate gene expression levels play an important role in the etiology of human diseases and complex traits. Although large-scale eQTL mapping studies routinely identify many local eQTLs, the molecular mechanisms by which genetic variants regulate expression remain unclear, particularly for distal eQTLs, which these studies are not well powered to detect. Here, we leveraged all variants (not just those that pass stringent significance thresholds) to analyze the functional architecture of local and distal regulation of gene expression in 15 human tissues by employing an extension of stratified LD-score regression that produces robust results in simulations. The top enriched functional categories in local regulation of peripheral-blood gene expression included coding regions (11.41\texttimes{}), conserved regions (4.67\texttimes{}), and four histone marks (p {$<$} 5~\texttimes{} 10-5 for all enrichments); local enrichments were similar across the 15 tissues. We also observed substantial enrichments for distal regulation of peripheral-blood gene expression: coding regions (4.47\texttimes{}), conserved regions (4.51\texttimes{}), and two histone marks (p {$<$} 3~\texttimes{} 10-7 for all enrichments). Analyses of the genetic correlation of gene expression across tissues confirmed that local regulation of gene expression is largely shared across tissues but that distal regulation is highly tissue specific. Our results elucidate the functional components of the genetic architecture of local and distal regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Disease risk variants identified by GWAS are predominantly noncoding, suggesting that gene regulation plays an important role. eQTL studies in unaffected individuals are often used to link disease-associated variants with the genes they regulate, relying on the hypothesis that noncoding regulatory effects are mediated by steady-state expression levels. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to estimate the proportion of disease heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression levels. The method, gene expression co-score regression (GECS regression), relies on the idea that, for a gene whose expression level affects a phenotype, SNPs with similar effects on the expression of that gene will have similar phenotypic effects. In order to distinguish directional effects mediated by gene expression from non-directional pleiotropic or tagging effects, GECS regression operates on pairs of cis SNPs in linkage equilibrium, regressing pairwise products of disease effect sizes on products of cis-eQTL effect sizes. We verified that GECS regression produces robust estimates of mediated effects in simulations. We applied the method to eQTL data in 44 tissues from the GTEx consortium (average NeQTL = 158 samples) in conjunction with GWAS summary statistics for 30 diseases and complex traits (average NGWAS = 88K) with low pairwise genetic correlation, estimating the proportion of SNP-heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression in the union of the 44 tissues. The mean estimate was 0.21 (s.e. = 0.01) across 30 traits, with a significantly positive estimate (p {$<$} 0.001) for every trait. Thus, assayed gene expression in bulk tissues mediates a statistically significant but modest proportion of disease heritability, motivating the development of additional assays to capture regulatory effects and the use of our method to estimate how much disease heritability they mediate.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {Author Summary An important goal in biology is to understand how genotype affects gene expression. Because gene expression varies across tissues, the relationship between genotype and gene expression may be tissue-specific. In this study, we used heritability approaches to study the regulation of gene expression in two tissue types, blood and adipose tissue, as well as the regulation of gene expression that is shared across these tissues. Heritability can be partitioned into cis and trans effects by assessing identity-by-descent (IBD) at the genomic location close to the expressed gene or genome-wide, respectively, and applying variance-components methods to partition the heritability of each gene. We estimated the proportion of gene expression heritability explained by cis regulation as 37\% in blood and 24\% in adipose tissue. Notably, the heritability shared across tissue types was primarily due to cis regulation. Thus, the relative contribution of cis versus trans regulation is expected to increase with the number of cell types present in the tissue being assayed, just as observed in our study and in a comparison to previous work on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). We specifically ruled out a substantial contribution of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance to heritability of gene expression in these cohorts by repeating our heritability analyses using segments shared IBD in distantly related Icelanders.},

  abstract = {Physical interaction of distal regulatory elements in three-dimensional space poses a significant challenge for studies of common disease, because noncoding risk variants may be substantial distances from the genes they regulate. Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture (CCC), usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of disease fine-mapping. Here, we developed a statistical model that uses Mendelian Randomisation within a Bayesian hierarchical model framework, and applied it to a novel ATAC-seq data from 100 individuals mapping over 15,000 putatively causal interactions between distal regions of open chromatin. Strikingly, the majority ({$>$}60\%) of interactions we detected were over distances of {$<$}20Kb, a range where CCC-based methods perform poorly. Because we can infer the direction of causal interactions, the model also significantly improves our ability to fine-map: when we applied it to an eQTL data set we reduced the number of variants in the 90\% credible set size by half. We experimentally validate one of our associations using CRISPR engineering of the BLK/FAM167A locus, which is associated with risk for a range of autoimmune diseases and show that the causal variant is likely to be a non-coding insertion within a CTCF binding motif. Our study suggests that many regulatory variants will be challenging to map to their cognate genes using CCC-based techniques, but association genetics of chromatin state can provide a powerful complement to these approaches.},

However, QC is a time-consuming and complex task, due to the massive size and versatile nature of RNA-seq data. Therefore, a convenient and comprehensive QC tool to assess RNA-seq quality is sorely needed.Results: We developed the RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate different aspects of RNA-seq experiments, such as sequence quality, GC bias, polymerase chain reaction bias, nucleotide composition bias, sequencing depth, strand specificity, coverage uniformity and read distribution over the genome structure. RSeQC takes both SAM and BAM files as input, which can be produced by most RNA-seq mapping tools as well as BED files, which are widely used for gene models. Most modules in RSeQC take advantage of R scripts for visualization, and they are notably efficient in dealing with large BAM/SAM files containing hundreds of millions of alignments.Availability and implementation: RSeQC is written in Python and C.

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \texttimes{} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide detection of transcription start sites (TSSs) has revealed that RNA Polymerase II transcription initiates at millions of positions in mammalian genomes. Most core promoters do not have a single TSS, but an array of closely located TSSs with different rates of initiation. As a rule, genes have more than one such core promoter; however, defining the boundaries between core promoters is not trivial. These discoveries prompt a re-evaluation of our models for transcription initiation. We describe a new framework for understanding the organization of transcription initiation. We show that initiation events are clustered on the chromosomes at multiple scales\textemdash{}clusters within clusters\textemdash{}indicating multiple regulatory processes. Within the smallest of such clusters, which can be interpreted as core promoters, the local DNA sequence predicts the relative transcription start usage of each nucleotide with a remarkable 91\% accuracy, implying the existence of a DNA code that determines TSS selection. Conversely, the total expression strength of such clusters is only partially determined by the local DNA sequence. Thus, the overall control of transcription can be understood as a combination of large- and small-scale effects; the selection of transcription start sites is largely governed by the local DNA sequence, whereas the transcriptional activity of a locus is regulated at a different level; it is affected by distal features or events such as enhancers and chromatin remodeling.},

These elements are characterized by distinct epigenomic profiles, such as expanded deposition of histone marks H3K27ac for super enhancers and H3K4me3 for broad domains, however little is known about how they interact with each other and the rest of the genome in three-dimensional chromatin space. Using network theory methods, we studied chromatin interactions between broad domains and super enhancers in three ENCODE cell lines (K562, MCF7, GM12878) obtained via ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and Hi-CHIP assays. In these networks, broad domains and super enhancers interact more frequently with each other compared to their typical counterparts. Network measures and graphlets revealed distinct connectivity patterns associated with these regulatory elements that are robust across cell types and alternative assays. Machine learning models showed that these connectivity patterns could effectively discriminate broad domains from typical promoters and super enhancers from typical enhancers. Finally, targets of broad domains in these networks were enriched in disease-causing SNPs of cognate cell types. Taken together these results suggest a robust and unique organization of the chromatin around broad domains and super enhancers: loci critical for pathologies and cell-specific functions.},

Tea and a Paper Jan 30 - Arushi

- Methods to call enhancers - Chromatin and TF based; now bidirectional transcription

- Some studies - act of transcription but not the RNA helps regulate gene expression

- Other studies - RNA helps TF recruitment

- Question: Is bidir transcription better that chromatin states in predicting enhancer activity.

- known: Not all enhancers are transcribed

- Conflicting results: transcription at other chromatin states - repressed and no signal. From our and previous analyses, bidir transcription enriched at promoters, enhancers all active states. LCL CAGE - strong depletion in repressed chromatin

- Conflicting conclusion - transcription would not be a good indicator of enhancer activity.

* Fig 1:enhancers - fine, others - would contain promoter and other active states so fine.

* Chromatin states were taken from BioMart generated from Segway. Should show enrichment of their enhancers in different chromatin states

* Methods for this are not at all clear.

~* Stable = CAGE; All = GRO-cap. What about sites observed by CAGE but not GRO-cap?

* Fig 2: Reporter assays from the Barak Cohen's paper - used mid point of enhancers - not DHS. Won't be a appropriate comparison. Also, stably transcribed enhnacers defined as any CAGE tag in entire chromatin state - noise!!. Bidir = any CAGE tags on both strands. What!?

* Their own HepG2 assay - what levels of bidir transcription for selected loci?

* Fig 3: Why merge stuff from 4 cell types?

* +ve correlation is if the coefficient is {$>$}0 and p{$<$}0.05

* Best physically interacting~ promoter information is thrown into the supplement

* fig 4: Majority of eRNA not spliced or polyA

* so enhancer state n=21k are those overlapping known annotations?

*Take Home* --

\begin{enumerate}

\item Very lax definition of considering transcription. Multiple libraries merged

\item No overlap of FANTOM K562 enhancers with regions tested in assay in Cohen paper- which was chromatin state midpoints.

\item Very generalized stable/unstable transcription definition with limited contribution towards interpretation.

\item Limited to exonic eRNA - very small fraction. Enhancers in general have more variation that promoters.

\item Therefore, calling enhancers form bidir loci and not just considering CAGE tags would be more helpful in identifying active enhancer

\item FANTOM enhancers are already seen to be more enriched in promoter/enhancer states

\item Another study Kheradpour et al performed MPRA on motifs within enhancer chromatin states - better than binding sites

\item 

Problem is with this statement in the conclusion:~

. Furthermore, this transcriptional signal alone is not sufficient to discriminate enhancers from other ac- tive regulatory regions in the genome. 

This is not substantiated because of their lax definition of bidirectionally transcribed loci.

  abstract = {The current focus on delivery of personalised (or precision) medicine reflects the expectation that developments in genomics, imaging and other domains will extend our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, and enable more effective targeting of current and future preventative and therapeutic options. The clinical benefits of this approach are already being realised in rare diseases and cancer but the impact on management of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, remains limited. This may reflect reliance on inappropriate models of disease architecture, based around rare, high-impact genetic and environmental exposures that are poorly suited to our emerging understanding of type 2 diabetes. This review proposes an alternative 'palette' model, centred on a molecular taxonomy that focuses on positioning an individual with respect to the major pathophysiological processes that contribute to diabetes risk and progression. This model anticipates that many individuals with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that affect several of these processes. One corollary of this model is that research efforts should, at least initially, be targeted towards identifying and characterising individuals whose adverse metabolic trajectory is dominated by perturbation in a restricted set of processes.},

  abstract = {In order to develop a catalog of regulatory sites in two major model organisms, Drosophilia melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the modERN consortium has systematically assayed the binding sites of transcription factors (TFs). Combined with data produced by our predecessor, modENCODE, we now have data for 262 TFs identifying 1.23M sites in the fly genome and 217 TFs identifying 0.67M sites in the worm genome. Because sites from different TFs are often overlapping and tightly clustered, they fall into 91,011 and 59,150 regions in the fly and worm, respectively, and these binding sites span as little as 8.7 Mb and 5.8 Mb in the two organisms. Clusters with large numbers of sites (so-called HOT regions) predominantly associate with broadly expressed genes, whereas clusters containing sites from just a few factors are associated with genes expressed in tissue specific patterns. All of the strains expressing GFP-tagged TFs are available at the stock centers and the ChIP-seq data are available through the ENCODE DCC, and also through a simple interface (http://epic.gs.washington.edu/modERN/) that facilitates rapid accessibility of processed datasets. These data will facilitate a vast number of scientific inquiries into the fuction of individual TFs in key developmental, metabolic, defense and homeostatic regulatory pathways, as well as provide a broader perspective on how individual TFs work together in local networks and globally across the lifespans of these two key model organisms.},

  abstract = {The histone modification state of genomic regions is hypothesized to reflect the regulatory activity of the underlying genomic DNA. Based on this hypothesis, the ENCODE Project Consortium measured the status of multiple histone modifications across the genome in several cell types and used these data to segment the genome into regions with different predicted regulatory activities. We measured the cis-regulatory activity of more than 2000 of these predictions in the K562 leukemia cell line. We tested genomic segments predicted to be Enhancers, Weak Enhancers, or Repressed elements in K562 cells, along with other sequences predicted to be Enhancers specific to the H1 human embryonic stem cell line (H1-hESC). Both Enhancer and Weak Enhancer sequences in K562 cells were more active than negative controls, although surprisingly, Weak Enhancer segmentations drove expression higher than did Enhancer segmentations. Lower levels of the covalent histone modifications H3K36me3 and H3K27ac, thought to mark active enhancers and transcribed gene bodies, associate with higher expression and partly explain the higher activity of Weak Enhancers over Enhancer predictions. While DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) is a good predictor of active sequences in our assay, transcription factor (TF) binding models need to be included in order to accurately identify highly expressed sequences. Overall, our results show that a significant fraction ({$\sim$}26\%) of the ENCODE enhancer predictions have regulatory activity, suggesting that histone modification states can reflect the cis-regulatory activity of sequences in the genome, but that specific sequence preferences, such as TF-binding sites, are the causal determinants of cis-regulatory activity.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Recent genetic and genomics approaches have yielded novel insights in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) but the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment still remain largely empirical. We reasoned that molecular characterization of SLE by whole blood transcriptomics may facilitate early diagnosis and personalized therapy. To this end, we analyzed genotypes and RNA-seq in 142 patients and 58 matched healthy individuals to define the global transcriptional signature of SLE. By controlling for the estimated proportions of circulating immune cell types, we show that the Interferon (IFN) and p53 pathways are robustly expressed. We also report cell-specific, disease-dependent regulation of gene expression and define a core/susceptibility and a flare/activity disease expression signature, with oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome regulation and cell cycle pathways being enriched in lupus flares. Using these data, we define a novel index of disease activity/severity by combining the validated Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) with a new variable derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data. We also delineate unique signatures across disease endo-phenotypes whereby active nephritis exhibits the most extensive changes in transcriptome, including prominent drugable signatures such as granulocyte and plasmablast/plasma cell activation. The substantial differences in gene expression between SLE and healthy individuals enables the classification of disease versus healthy status with median sensitivity and specificity of 83\% and 100\%, respectively. We explored the genetic regulation of blood transcriptome in SLE and found 3142 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By integration of SLE genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and eQTLs from 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) cosortium, we demonstrate that the genetic causality of SLE arises from multiple tissues with the top causal tissue being the liver, followed by brain basal ganglia, adrenal gland and whole blood. Collectively, our study defines distinct susceptibility and activity/severity signatures in SLE that may facilitate diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized therapy.},

  abstract = {Many disease risk loci identified in genome-wide association studies are present in non-coding regions of the genome. It is hypothesized that these variants affect complex traits by acting as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that influence expression of nearby genes. This indicates that many causal variants for complex traits are likely to be causal variants for gene expression. Hence, identifying causal variants for gene expression is important for elucidating the genetic basis of not only gene expression but also complex traits. However, detecting causal variants is challenging due to complex genetic correlation among variants known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the presence of multiple causal variants within a locus. Although several fine-mapping approaches have been developed to overcome these challenges, they may produce large sets of putative causal variants when true causal variants are in high LD with many non-causal variants. In eQTL studies, there is an additional source of information that can be used to improve fine-mapping called allele-specific expression (ASE) that measures imbalance in gene expression due to different alleles. In this work, we develop a novel statistical method that leverages both ASE and eQTL information to detect causal variants that regulate gene expression. We illustrate through simulations and application to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset that our method identifies the true causal variants with higher specificity than an approach that uses only eQTL information. In the GTEx dataset, our method achieves the median reduction rate of 11\% in the number of putative causal variants.},

  abstract = {Distant-acting tissue-specific enhancers, which regulate gene expression, vastly outnumber protein-coding genes in mammalian genomes, but the functional importance of this regulatory complexity remains unclear1,2. Here we show that the pervasive presence of multiple enhancers with similar activities near the same gene confers phenotypic robustness to loss-of-function mutations in individual enhancers. We used genome editing to create 23 mouse deletion lines and inter-crosses, including both single and combinatorial enhancer deletions at seven distinct loci required for limb development. Unexpectedly, none of the ten deletions of individual enhancers caused noticeable changes in limb morphology. By contrast, the removal of pairs of limb enhancers near the same gene resulted in discernible phenotypes, indicating that enhancers function redundantly in establishing normal morphology. In a genetic background sensitized by reduced baseline expression of the target gene, even single enhancer deletions caused limb abnormalities, suggesting that functional redundancy is conferred by additive effects of enhancers on gene expression levels. A genome-wide analysis integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 29 developmental mouse tissues revealed that mammalian genes are very commonly associated with multiple enhancers that have similar spatiotemporal activity. Systematic exploration of three representative developmental structures (limb, brain and heart) uncovered more than one thousand cases in which five or more enhancers with redundant activity patterns were found near the same gene. Together, our data indicate that enhancer redundancy is a remarkably widespread feature of mammalian genomes that provides an effective regulatory buffer to prevent deleterious phenotypic consequences upon the loss of individual enhancers.},

We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms.

  abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by promoters, which initiate transcription, and enhancers, which control their temporal and spatial activity. However, the discovery that mammalian enhancers also initiate transcription questions the inherent differences between enhancers and promoters. Here, we investigate the transcriptional properties of enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis using characterized developmental enhancers. We show that while the timing of enhancer transcription is generally correlated with enhancer activity, the levels and directionality of transcription are highly varied among active enhancers. To assess how this impacts function, we developed a dual transgenic assay to simultaneously measure enhancer and promoter activities from a single element in the same embryo. Extensive transgenic analysis revealed a relationship between the direction of endogenous transcription and the ability to function as an enhancer or promoter in vivo, although enhancer RNA (eRNA) production and activity are not always strictly coupled. Some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio\textendash{}temporal expression. Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while unidirectional promoters generally cannot. The balance between enhancer and promoter activity is generally reflected in the levels and directionality of eRNA transcription and is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements themselves.},

  abstract = {Regulation by gene-distal enhancers is critical for cell type-specific and condition-specific patterns of gene expression. Thus, to understand the basis of gene activity in a given cell type or tissue, we must identify the precise locations of enhancers and functionally characterize their behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that transcription is a nearly universal feature of enhancers in Drosophila and mammalian cells and that nascent RNA sequencing strategies are optimal for identification of both enhancers and superenhancers. We dissect the mechanisms governing enhancer transcription and discover remarkable similarities to transcription at protein-coding genes. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) undergoes regulated pausing and release at enhancers. However, as compared with mRNA genes, RNAPII at enhancers is less stable and more prone to early termination. Furthermore, we found that the level of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methylation at enhancers corresponds to transcriptional activity such that highly active enhancers display H3K4 trimethylation rather than the H3K4 monomethylation considered a hallmark of enhancers. Finally, our work provides insights into the unique characteristics of superenhancers, which stimulate high-level gene expression through rapid pause release; interestingly, this property renders associated genes resistant to the loss of factors that stabilize paused RNAPII.},

Together, these studies support recent work in mammalian cells that indicates that most active enhancers drive local transcription using factors and mechanisms similar to those of promoters. Intriguingly, enhancer transcription is shown to be coordinated by SPT5- and P-TEFb-mediated pause\textendash{}release, but the pause half-life is shorter, and termination is more rapid at enhancers than at promoters. Moreover, bidirectional transcription from promoters is associated with enhancer activity, lending further credence to models in which regulatory elements exist along a spectrum of promoter-ness and enhancer-ness.

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

Nascent transcription assays are a relatively new set of high throughput techniques that measure the location of actively engaged RNA polymerase genome wide. Hence, nascent transcription is a rich source of information on the regulation of RNA polymerase activity. To fully dissect this data requires the development of stochastic models that can both deconvolve the stages of polymerase activity and identify significant changes in activity between experiments.Results: We present a generative, probabilistic model of RNA polymerase that fully describes loading, initiation, elongation and termination. We fit this model genome wide and profile the enzymatic activity of RNA polymerase across various loci and following experimental perturbation. We observe striking correlation of predicted loading events and regulatory chromatin marks. We provide principled statistics that compute probabilities reminiscent of traveler's and divergent ratios.

  abstract = {Distal enhancer elements in DNA enable higher-order chromatin interactions that facilitate gene expression programs and thus contribute to cellular phenotype and function. In the brain, enhancer-promoter interactions help to ensure cell- and tissue-specific gene expression profiles, defining which genes are active during neuronal specification and which genes remain accessible in adult neurons. In addition to their close links to gene activation, enhancer elements themselves are subject to widespread, bidirectional transcription that yield non-coding enhancer RNA (eRNA). However, although eRNAs are correlated with overall enhancer activity, the precise function of eRNAs remains controversial. Here, we examined the function of eRNAs arising from multiple enhancers near the well-characterized immediate early gene Fos (also known as c-Fos). We show that eRNA transcription from Fos enhancers is dynamically modulated by various forms of neuronal activity, requires RNA polymerase II, and precedes activity-dependent induction of Fos mRNA. Visualization of Fos eRNA transcripts on a single cell level using single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed localization within the cell nucleus. Anti-sense based Fos eRNA knockdown decreased Fos mRNA expression, whereas mRNA knockdown did not affect eRNA levels. Targeted stimulation of eRNA synthesis from Fos enhancers using CRISPR-dCas9 fusion proteins produced corresponding increases in Fos mRNA expression, with limited cross-talk between enhancers. Similarly, CRISPR-targeted delivery of eRNA to a Fos enhancer elevated mRNA induction following neuronal depolarization. Finally, we show that anti-sense based knockdown of a single Fos eRNA is sufficient to alter neuronal physiology. Together, these results suggest that RNAs transcribed from neuronal enhancers are important regulators of enhancer-driven gene regulatory programs and neuronal function.},

Analysis of \textasciitilde{}27M variants (\textasciitilde{}21M with minor allele frequency [MAF]{$<$}5\%), identified 243 genome-wide significant loci (p{$<$}5x10-8; MAF 0.02\%-50\%; odds ratio [OR] 1.04-8.05), 135 not previously-implicated in T2D-predisposition. Conditional analyses revealed 160 additional distinct association signals (p{$<$}10-5) within the identified loci. The combined set of 403 T2D-risk signals includes 56 low-frequency (0.5\%{$\leq$}MAF{$<$}5\%) and 24 rare (MAF{$<$}0.5\%) index SNPs at 60 loci, including 14 with estimated allelic OR{$>$}2. Forty-one of the signals displayed effect-size heterogeneity between BMI-unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Increased sample size and improved imputation led to substantially more precise localisation of causal variants than previously attained: at 51 signals, the lead variant after fine-mapping accounted for {$>$}80\% posterior probability of association (PPA) and at 18 of these, PPA exceeded 99\%. Integration with islet regulatory annotations enriched for T2D association further reduced median credible set size (from 42 variants to 32) and extended the number of index variants with PPA{$>$}80\% to 73. Although most signals mapped to regulatory sequence, we identified 18 genes as human validated therapeutic targets through coding variants that are causal for disease. Genome wide chip heritability accounted for 18\% of T2D-risk, and individuals in the 2.5\% extremes of a polygenic risk score generated from the GWAS data differed {$>$}9-fold in risk. Our observations highlight how increases in sample size and variant diversity deliver enhanced discovery and single-variant resolution of causal T2D-risk alleles, and the consequent impact on mechanistic insights and clinical translation.},

  abstract = {Understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq)1, we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2\textendash{}4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6\textendash{}8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10\textendash{}11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10\textendash{}12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo's more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species2,3,4. We identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90\%. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types.},

  abstract = {Hidden effects of Mendelian inheritance
Identifying the determinate factors of genetic disease has been quite successful for Mendelian inheritance of large-effect pathogenic variants. In these cases, two non- or low-functioning genes contribute to disease. However, Mendelian effects of lesser strength have generally been ignored when looking at genomic consequences in human health. Bastarache et al. used electronic records to identify the phenotypic effects of previously unidentified Mendelian variations. Their analysis suggests that individuals with undiagnosed Mendelian diseases may be more prevalent in the general population than assumed. Because of this, genetic analysis may be able to assist clinicians in arriving at a diagnosis.
Science, this issue p. 1233
Genetic association studies often examine features independently, potentially missing subpopulations with multiple phenotypes that share a single cause. We describe an approach that aggregates phenotypes on the basis of patterns described by Mendelian diseases. We mapped the clinical features of 1204 Mendelian diseases into phenotypes captured from the electronic health record (EHR) and summarized this evidence as phenotype risk scores (PheRSs). In an initial validation, PheRS distinguished cases and controls of five Mendelian diseases. Applying PheRS to 21,701 genotyped individuals uncovered 18 associations between rare variants and phenotypes consistent with Mendelian diseases. In 16 patients, the rare genetic variants were associated with severe outcomes such as organ transplants. PheRS can augment rare-variant interpretation and may identify subsets of patients with distinct genetic causes for common diseases.
Electronic health records coupled with exome sequencing identify disease phenotypes linked to Mendelian inheritance.

  abstract = {Although it has previously been shown that Neanderthals contributed DNA to modern humans1,2, not much is known about the genetic diversity of Neanderthals or the relationship between late Neanderthal populations at the time at which their last interactions with early modern humans occurred and before they eventually disappeared. Our ability to retrieve DNA from a larger number of Neanderthal individuals has been limited by poor preservation of endogenous DNA3 and contamination of Neanderthal skeletal remains by large amounts of microbial and present-day human DNA3,4,5. Here we use hypochlorite treatment6 of as little as 9 mg of bone or tooth powder to generate between 1- and 2.7-fold genomic coverage of five Neanderthals who lived around 39,000 to 47,000 years ago (that is, late Neanderthals), thereby doubling the number of Neanderthals for which genome sequences are available. Genetic similarity among late Neanderthals is well predicted by their geographical location, and comparison to the genome of an older Neanderthal from the Caucasus2,7 indicates that a population turnover is likely to have occurred, either in the Caucasus or throughout Europe, towards the end of Neanderthal history. We find that the bulk of Neanderthal gene flow into early modern humans originated from one or more source populations that diverged from the Neanderthals that were studied here at least 70,000 years ago, but after they split from a previously sequenced Neanderthal from Siberia2 around 150,000 years ago. Although four of the Neanderthals studied here post-date the putative arrival of early modern humans into Europe, we do not detect any recent gene flow from early modern humans in their ancestry.},

Here we present an analysis framework for the 'Prioritisation of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs' (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 213 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98\% of these loci (n=209), the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritised by ProGeM. Systematic benchmarking analyses revealed that 70\% (n=150) of the candidate causal genes were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of true positive causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. Finally, we provide evidence that these conclusions may also apply to cis-protein QTLs and loci associated with complex diseases. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.},

  abstract = {Summary
Transcriptional dysregulation of the MYC oncogene is among the most frequent events in aggressive tumor cells, and this is generally accomplished by acquisition of a super-enhancer somewhere within the 2.8 Mb TAD where MYC resides. We find that these diverse cancer-specific super-enhancers, differing in size and location, interact with the MYC gene through a common and conserved CTCF binding site located 2 kb upstream of the MYC promoter. Genetic perturbation of this enhancer-docking site in tumor cells reduces CTCF binding, super-enhancer interaction, MYC gene expression, and cell proliferation. CTCF binding is highly sensitive to DNA methylation, and this enhancer-docking site, which is hypomethylated in diverse cancers, can be inactivated through epigenetic editing with dCas9-DNMT. Similar enhancer-docking sites occur at other genes, including genes with prominent roles in multiple cancers, suggesting a mechanism by which tumor cell oncogenes can generally hijack enhancers. These results provide insights into mechanisms that allow a single target gene to be regulated by diverse enhancer elements in different cell types.},

  abstract = {General regulatory factors (GRFs), such as Reb1, Abf1, Rap1, Mcm1, and Cbf1, positionally organize yeast chromatin through interactions with a core consensus DNA sequence. It is assumed that sequence recognition via direct base readout suffices for specificity and that spurious nonfunctional sites are rendered inaccessible by chromatin. We tested these assumptions through genome-wide mapping of GRFs in vivo and in purified biochemical systems at near\textendash{}base pair (bp) resolution using several ChIP-exo\textendash{}based assays. We find that computationally predicted DNA shape features (e.g., minor groove width, helix twist, base roll, and propeller twist) that are not defined by a unique consensus sequence are embedded in the nonunique portions of GRF motifs and contribute critically to sequence-specific binding. This dual source specificity occurs at GRF sites in promoter regions where chromatin organization starts. Outside of promoter regions, strong consensus sites lack the shape component and consequently lack an intrinsic ability to bind cognate GRFs, without regard to influences from chromatin. However, sites having a weak consensus and low intrinsic affinity do exist in these regions but are rendered inaccessible in a chromatin environment. Thus, GRF site-specificity is achieved through integration of favorable DNA sequence and shape readouts in promoter regions and by chromatin-based exclusion from fortuitous weak sites within gene bodies. This study further revealed a severe G/C nucleotide cross-linking selectivity inherent in all formaldehyde-based ChIP assays, which includes ChIP-seq. However, for most tested proteins, G/C selectivity did not appreciably affect binding site detection, although it does place limits on the quantitativeness of occupancy levels.},

in vitro - PB-seq - uses the whole genome (not oligos) without additional proteins

Study TFs that have strong consensus sites, organize nucleosomes, not many binding partners in yeast.

Compare ChIP exo and PB exo. Most ChIp sites come up on PB, but PB has new sites also. These sites are restricted by chromatin in vivo.

- ChIP crosslinking bias - where you have G/C near protein lysines, lots of crosslinking bias

- Shape factors in motif regions of low sequence definition.

However, it remains unclear how structure relates to function and, in this work, we aim at bridging both by assembling a dataset that combines the activity of regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers and promoters), expression of genes and genetic variations of 317 individuals and across two cell types. We show that the regulatory activity is structured within 12,583 Cis Regulatory Domains (CRDs) that are cell type specific and highly reflective of the local (i.e. Topologically Associating Domains) and global (i.e. A/B nuclear compartments) nuclear organization of the chromatin. These CRDs essentially delimit the sets of active regulatory elements involved in the transcription of most genes, thereby capturing complex regulatory networks in which the effects of regulatory variants are propagated and combined to finally mediate expression Quantitative Trait Loci.

  abstract = {The gene targets of enhancer activity in pancreatic islets are largely unknown, impeding discovery of islet regulatory networks involved in type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We mapped chromatin state, accessibility and conformation using ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and Hi-C in human pancreatic islets, which we integrated with T2D genetic fine-mapping and islet expression QTL data. Active islet regulatory elements preferentially interacted with other active elements, often at distances over 1MB, and we identified target genes for thousands of distal islet enhancers. A third of T2D risk signals mapped in islet enhancers, and target genes regulated by these signals were specifically involved in processes related to protein transport and secretion. Among implicated target genes of T2D islet enhancer signals with no prior known role in islet function, we demonstrated that reduced IGF2BP2 activity in mouse islets leads to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These results link distal islet enhancer regulation of protein secretion and transport to genetic risk of T2D, and highlight the utility of high-throughput chromatin conformation maps to uncover the gene regulatory networks of complex disease.},

  abstract = {Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful paradigms for mapping the determinants of gene expression and organismal phenotypes, respectively. However, eQTL mapping and GWAS are limited in scope (to naturally occurring, common genetic variants) and resolution (by linkage disequilibrium). Here, we present crisprQTL mapping, a framework in which large numbers of CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). crisprQTL mapping is analogous to conventional human eQTL studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells; genetic variants replaced by unique combinations of unlinked guide RNA (gRNA)-programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue-level RNA-seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA-seq of many cells. By randomly introducing gRNAs, a single population of cells can be leveraged to test for association between each perturbation and the expression of any potential target gene, analogous to how eQTL studies leverage populations of humans to test millions of genetic variants for associations with expression in a genome-wide manner. However, crisprQTL mapping is neither limited to naturally occurring, common genetic variants nor by linkage disequilibrium. As a proof-of-concept, we applied crisprQTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease-dead Cas9 tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean "allele frequency" of 1.1\% into a population of 47,650 profiled human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identified per cell). We tested for differential expression of all genes within 1 megabase of each candidate enhancer, effectively evaluating 17,584 potential enhancer-target gene relationships within a single experiment. At an empirical false discovery rate of 10\%, we identify 128 cis crisprQTLs (11\%) whose targeting resulted in downregulation of 105 nearby genes. crisprQTLs were strongly enriched for proximity to their target genes (median 34.3 kilobases) and the strength of H3K27ac, p300, and lineage-specific transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks. Our results establish the power of the eQTL mapping paradigm as applied to programmed variation in populations of cells, rather than natural variation in populations of individuals. We anticipate that crisprQTL mapping will facilitate the comprehensive elucidation of the cis-regulatory architecture of the human genome.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring.

With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

The number of results from such studies is constantly increasing but the challenge lying forward is to identify the biological context in which these statistically significant candidate variants act. Regulatory variation plays an important role in shaping phenotypic differences among individuals and thus is very likely to also influence disease susceptibility. As such, integrating gene expression data and other disease relevant intermediate phenotypes with GWAS results could potentially help prioritize fine-mapping efforts and provide a shortcut to disease biology. Combining these different levels of information in a meaningful way is however not trivial. In the present review, we outline the several approaches that have been explored so far in this sense and their achievements. We also discuss the limitations of the methods and how upcoming technological developments could help circumvent these limitations.

  volume = {19},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {Background
Bisulfite sequencing is widely employed to study the role of DNA methylation in disease; however, the data suffer from biases due to coverage depth variability. Imputation of methylation values at low-coverage sites may mitigate these biases while also identifying important genomic features associated with predictive power.

Results
Here we describe BoostMe, a method for imputing low-quality DNA methylation estimates within whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. BoostMe uses a gradient boosting algorithm, XGBoost, and leverages information from multiple samples for prediction. We find that BoostMe outperforms existing algorithms in speed and accuracy when applied to WGBS of human tissues. Furthermore, we show that imputation improves concordance between WGBS and the MethylationEPIC array at low WGBS depth, suggesting improved WGBS accuracy after imputation.

Conclusions
Our findings support the use of BoostMe as a preprocessing step for WGBS analysis.

Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10\% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.},

  issn = {1088-9051, 1549-5469},
  abstract = {Genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are enriched in genes encoding synaptic proteins and chromatin regulators. Although the role of synaptic proteins in ASDs is widely studied, the mechanism by which chromatin regulators contribute to ASD risk remains poorly understood. Upon profiling and analyzing the transcriptional and epigenomic features of genes expressed in the cortex, we uncovered a unique set of long genes that contain broad enhancer-like chromatin domains (BELD) spanning across their entire gene bodies. Analyses of these BELD genes show that they are highly transcribed with frequent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiation, low Pol II pausing, and exhibit frequent chromatin-chromatin interactions within their gene bodies. These BELD features are conserved from rodents to humans, enriched in genes involved in synaptic function, and appear postnatally concomitant with synapse development. Importantly, we find that BELD genes are highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASDs, and that their expression is preferentially downregulated in individuals with idiopathic autism. Finally, we find that the transcription of BELD genes is particularly sensitive to alternations in ASD-associated chromatin regulators. These findings suggest that the epigenomic regulation of BELD genes is important for postnatal cortical development and lends support to a model by which mutations in chromatin regulators causally contribute to ASDs by preferentially impairing BELD gene transcription.},

Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95\% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50\% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n = 13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n = 3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n = 10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn's disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

However, the potential for interpretation and application of these data for clinical assessment of outcomes of interest, and prediction of disease risk, is currently not fully realized. Many common, complex diseases now have numerous, well-established "risk" loci, and likely harbor many genetic determinants with effects too small to be detected at genome-wide levels of statistical significance. A simple and intuitive approach for converting genetic data to a predictive measure of disease susceptibility is to aggregate the risk effects of these loci into a single genetic risk score. Here, some common methods and software packages for calculating genetic risk scores, with focus on studies of common, complex diseases, are described. The basic information needed as well as important considerations for constructing genetic risk scores, including specific requirements for phenotypic and genetic data, and limitations in their application is reviewed. \textcopyright{} 2016 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

They were tested in 1,181 T2D cases and 9,092 controls of the Estonian Biobank cohort. The best-fitting GRS was chosen for the subsequent analysis of incident T2D (386 cases).Results:The best fit was provided by a novel doubly weighted GRS that captures the effect of 1,000 SNPs. The hazard for incident T2D was 3.45 times (95\% CI: 2.31\textendash{}5.17) higher in the highest GRS quintile compared with the lowest quintile, after adjusting for body mass index and other known predictors. Adding GRS to the prediction model for 5-year T2D risk resulted in continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.324 (95\% CI: 0.211\textendash{}0.444). In addition, a significant effect of the GRS on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed.Conclusion:The proposed GRS would improve the accuracy of T2D risk prediction when added to the currently used set of predictors.Genet Med 19 3, 322\textendash{}329.},

  abstract = {The majority of gene loci that have been associated with type 2 diabetes play a role in pancreatic islet function. To evaluate the role of islet gene expression in the etiology of diabetes, we sensitized a genetically diverse mouse population with a Western diet high in fat (45\% kcal) and sucrose (34\%) and carried out genome-wide association mapping of diabetes-related phenotypes. We quantified mRNA abundance in the islets and identified 18,820 expression QTL. We applied mediation analysis to identify candidate causal driver genes at loci that affect the abundance of numerous transcripts. These include two genes previously associated with monogenic diabetes (PDX1 and HNF4A), as well as three genes with nominal association with diabetes-related traits in humans (FAM83E, IL6ST, and SAT2). We grouped transcripts into gene modules and mapped regulatory loci for modules enriched with transcripts specific for {$\alpha$}-cells, and another specific for {$\delta$}-cells. However, no single module enriched for {$\beta$}-cell-specific transcripts, suggesting heterogeneity of gene expression patterns within the {$\beta$}-cell population. A module enriched in transcripts associated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism was the most strongly correlated with physiological traits that reflect insulin resistance. Although the mice in this study were not overtly diabetic, the analysis of pancreatic islet gene expression under dietary-induced stress enabled us to identify correlated variation in groups of genes that are functionally linked to diabetes-associated physiological traits. Our analysis suggests an expected degree of concordance between diabetes-associated loci in the mouse and those found in human populations, and demonstrates how the mouse can provide evidence to support nominal associations found in human genome-wide association mapping.},

  abstract = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several hundred susceptibility loci for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). One critical, but unresolved, issue concerns the extent to which the mechanisms through which these diverse signals influencing T2D predisposition converge on a limited set of biological processes. However, the causal variants identified by GWAS mostly fall into non-coding sequence, complicating the task of defining the effector transcripts through which they operate. Here, we describe implementation of an analytical pipeline to address this question. First, we integrate multiple sources of genetic, genomic, and biological data to assign positional candidacy scores to the genes that map to T2D GWAS signals. Second, we introduce genes with high scores as seeds within a network optimization algorithm (the asymmetric prize-collecting Steiner Tree approach) which uses external, experimentally-confirmed protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to generate high confidence subnetworks. Third, we use GWAS data to test the T2D-association enrichment of the "non-seed" proteins introduced into the network, as a measure of the overall functional connectivity of the network. We find: (a) non-seed proteins in the T2D protein-interaction network generated (comprising 705 nodes) are enriched for association to T2D (p=0.0014) but not control traits; (b) stronger T2D-enrichment for islets than other tissues when we use RNA expression data to generate tissue-specific PPI networks ; and (c) enhanced enrichment (p=3.9x10-5) when we combine analysis of the islet-specific PPI network with a focus on the subset of T2D GWAS loci which act through defective insulin secretion. These analyses reveal a pattern of non-random functional connectivity between causal candidate genes at T2D GWAS loci, and highlight the products of genes including YWHAG, SMAD4 or CDK2 as contributors to T2D-relevant islet dysfunction. The approach we describe can be applied to other complex genetic and genomic data sets, facilitating integration of diverse data types into disease-associated networks},

The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using~TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting~a~hypothesis centered on ``chromatin-state'' to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a~computational method to infer causal enhancer-gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer {$\sim$}140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers.},

  volume = {102},
  issn = {0002-9297},
  abstract = {Causal genes and variants within genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci can be identified by integrating GWAS statistics with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and determining which variants underlie both GWAS and eQTL signals. Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissect this signal into multiple conditionally independent signals for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (n = 467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63\% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context-specific (e.g., tissue-, cell type-, or developmental time point-specific) regulation of gene expression. Integrating the 2014 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS and CMC primary and conditional eQTL data reveals 40 loci with strong evidence for co-localization (posterior probability {$>$} 0.8), including six loci with co-localization of conditional eQTL. Our co-localization analyses support previously reported genes, identify novel genes associated with schizophrenia risk, and provide specific hypotheses for their functional follow-up.},

GWAS meta analysis for intelligence - 14 cohorts

Different measures of intelligence -{$>$} Variance across tests can be modeled as a latent factor called g (general factor of intelligence). g factors are extracted from different tests and these correlate well - universality of g. Encompasses verbal and mathematical ability, abstract reasoning, processing speed, executive functioning, spatial reasoning, memory. Principal component extracted from multiple tests from different cognitive sub-domains (g factor)

! included genes for good

- Initial QC metrics:- GWAS in individual cohorts

\begin{enumerate}

\item genetic correlations between cohorts was good (LD score regression) [what fraction of phenotypic variance is due to common genetic factors?]

\item correlations across age groups ( was good)

\item heterogeneity between cohorts for SNP associations - is~ sign concordance more than that observed by chance from a binomial distribution = (this was considerable)

\end{enumerate}

- Filtered SNPs based on quality score, MAF etc

- meta analysis using METAL - identified 12,110 SNPs - identified independent SNPs based on LD r2{$<$}0.6. Then defined boundaries. (index=242). Then took all r2{$>$}0.6 proxies of all their independent SNPs (\textasciitilde{}20k)

- Replication - GWAS of educational attainment - there should be genetic correlation and sign concordance.

- Polygenic risk score - \textasciitilde{}5.2\% variance explained in 4 independent samples

\textasciitilde{}200 loci, GWAS + eQTL + other functional assays

- Enrichment in annotations using LD score regression -

~~~ GWAS - inflated because of cryptic relatedness or true polygenicity. Quantify each by calculating the relationship between test statistics and LD. Because true causal variant will have inflated test stats proportional to their LD, but population stratification purely from genetic drift will not depend on LD.

Consequently, if we regress the {$\chi$}2 statistics from GWAS against LD Score (LD Score regression), the intercept minus one is an estimator of the mean contribution of confounding bias to the inflation in the test statistics.

Heritability = proportion of variance that can be attributed to genetic variation between individuals

narrow sense heritability = proportion of phenotypic variation attributed to additive effects

GWAS test chi-sq = LDscore*heritability*N + N*confounders + 1

enrichment/depletion of heritability in each category is calculated as the proportion of heritability attributable to SNPs in the specified category divided by the proportion of total SNPs annotated to that category

- Many coding variants

- Gene mapping: (FUMA)

\begin{enumerate}

\item positional - 10 kb window

\item eQTL: used GTEx data

\item Chromosome conformation

\end{enumerate}

- Genome wide gene-based association (GWGAS) (MAGMA):

\begin{enumerate}

\item Association between all SNPs in a gene (less multiple testing, more power).. FUMA was single SNP - single SNPs have small effect sizes

\item 15 genes show interactions between independent loci - starting points?

\end{enumerate}

-~ Gene set enrichment - GO: conditional analysis - nervous system development, CNS neuron differentiation, regulation of synapse structure

- Genes expressed in brain

- Genetic correlation with other traits

~~~ proportion of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance}{variance} that two traits share due to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene}{genetic} causes

- Mendelian randomization -identify causal relationship between intelligence and traits correlated with intelligence

~~~ summary level data - causal association between risk factor (exposure) and an outcome by using independent genome wide significant SNPs as instrumental variables. Causal effect of exposure on outcome as a function of SNPs effects on exposure and SNPs effects on the outcome. - assuming - effect of SNP on exposure is only via mediation via the phenotypic causal pathway.

IntroductionMany genetic variants associated with common disease susceptibility occur close to immune-related genes in noncoding DNA, suggestive of a regulatory function. The definition of functional variants and the specific genes that they regulate remains challenging and in many cases is unresolved. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of variants, including those implicated in disease, may show activity in a context-specific manner and therefore only be identifiable upon triggering of immune responses.
{$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/343/6175/1246949/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Context-specific genetic association with differential gene expression in IFN-{$\beta$} signaling. (A) A local association (cis-eQTL) with IFNB1 expression for a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2275888) revealed after 2 hours of LPS stimulation of monocytes. (B) This genetic marker shows association with expression of 17 genes on different chromosomes (trans-eQTLs) after 24 hours of LPS stimulation, forming a gene network (C) consistent with the IFN-{$\beta$} signaling cascade.
MethodsWe mapped interindividual variation in gene expression as a quantitative trait, defining expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To investigate the effect of innate immune stimuli on eQTLs, we exposed primary CD14+ human monocytes from 432 European volunteers to the inflammatory proxies interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) or differing durations (2 or 24 hours) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). eQTL mapping was performed on a genome-wide basis with an additive linear model. A subset of 228 individuals with expression data available for all experimental conditions enabled cross-treatment comparisons.
ResultsStimulation with LPS or IFN-{$\gamma$} resulted in profound effects across monocyte eQTLs, with hundreds of genes and associated pathways demonstrating context-specific eQTLs dependent on the type and duration of stimulus. Context-specific eQTLs frequently intersected established canonical pathways of monocyte signaling and included key nodal genes and effector molecules. These eQTLs are typically more distal to the transcriptional start site and, in some cases, showed reversal of effect between conditions. We also found stimulation reveals novel eQTLs with simultaneous effects involving many genes (trans-eQTLs). Examples included coding polymorphisms in CYP1B1, P2RY11, and IDO2 that modulate activity and develop trans network effects upon stimulation; an LPS-specific IFN-{$\beta$} cytokine network response driven by a cis-eQTL for IFNB1 that was only revealed over time; an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor modulated network up-regulated by IFN-{$\gamma$} involving a cis-eQTL for IRF2; and an IFN-{$\gamma$}\textendash{}inducible trans gene network involving the transcription factor NFE2L3. We find trans associations to the major histocompatibility complex are dependent on context, paralleling the expression of class II genes. Induced eQTLs were enriched for disease-risk loci with context-specific associations to many putative causal genes, including at ATM, IRF8, and CCR3. Conditional analysis defined additional independent stimulus-specific peaks of association for a given gene. For CARD9 we observed, in addition to a constitutive eQTL informative for a genome-wide association study locus for Crohn's disease, a stimulus-specific peak eQTL after IFN-{$\gamma$}, defining a further independent signal of disease association.
DiscussionInterindividual variation in immune responses is accompanied by diverging patterns of gene regulation dependent on underlying genotype. In human monocytes, many regulatory variants display functionality only after pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli. By considering the cellular and environmental context relevant to disease, it is possible to more extensively resolve functional genetic variants and the specific modulated genes associated with disease.
Immune Variation
It is difficult to determine the mechanistic consequences of context-dependent genetic variants, some of which may be related to disease (see the Perspective by Gregersen). Two studies now report on the effects of stimulating immunological monocytes and dendritic cells with proteins that can elicit a response to bacterial or viral infection and assess the functional links between genetic variants and profiles of gene expression. M. N. Lee et al. (10.1126/science.1246980) analyzed the expression of more than 400 genes, in dendritic cells from 30 healthy subjects, which revealed how expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) affect gene expression within the interferon-{$\beta$} and the Toll-like receptor 3 and 4 pathways. Fairfax et al. (10.1126/science.1246949) performed a genome-wide analysis to show that many eQTLs affected monocyte gene expression in a stimulus- or time-specific manner.
To systematically investigate the impact of immune stimulation upon regulatory variant activity, we exposed primary monocytes from 432 healthy Europeans to interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) or differing durations of lipopolysaccharide and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). More than half of cis-eQTLs identified, involving hundreds of genes and associated pathways, are detected specifically in stimulated monocytes. Induced innate immune activity reveals multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), coding variants altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-{$\beta$} cytokine network showing temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor\textendash{}modulated network. Induced eQTL are significantly enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying context-specific associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and IRF8. Thus, applying pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli assists resolution of functional genetic variants.

  abstract = {By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well., Gene and gene-set analysis are statistical methods for analysing multiple genetic markers simultaneously to determine their joint effect. These methods can be used when the effects of individual markers is too weak to detect, which is a common problem when studying polygenic traits. Moreover, gene-set analysis can provide additional insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying the genetic component of a trait. Although a number of methods for gene and gene-set analysis are available however, they generally suffer from various statistical issues and can be very time-consuming to run. We have therefore developed a new method called MAGMA to address these issues, and have compared it to a number of existing tools. Our results show that MAGMA detects more associated genes and gene-sets than other methods, and is also considerably faster. The way the method is set up also makes it highly flexible. This makes it suitable as a basis for more general statistical analyses aimed at investigating more complex research questions.},

ChromHMM learns chromatin-state signatures using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly models the combinatorial presence or absence of each mark. ChromHMM uses these signatures to generate a genome-wide annotation for each cell type by calculating the most probable state for each genomic segment. ChromHMM provides an automated enrichment analysis of the resulting annotations to facilitate the functional interpretations of each chromatin state. ChromHMM is distinguished by its modeling emphasis on combinations of marks, its tight integration with downstream functional enrichment analyses, its speed, and its ease of use.

  abstract = {Summary
The enhancer regions of the myogenic master regulator MyoD give rise to at least two enhancer RNAs. Core enhancer eRNA (CEeRNA) regulates transcription of the adjacent MyoD gene, whereas DRReRNA affects expression of Myogenin in trans. We found that DRReRNA is recruited at the Myogenin locus, where it colocalizes with Myogenin nascent transcripts. DRReRNA associates with the cohesin complex, and this association correlates with its transactivating properties. Despite being expressed in undifferentiated cells, cohesin is not loaded on Myogenin until the cells start expressing DRReRNA, which is then required for cohesin chromatin recruitment and maintenance. Functionally, depletion of either cohesin or DRReRNA reduces chromatin accessibility, prevents Myogenin activation, and hinders muscle cell differentiation. Thus, DRReRNA ensures spatially appropriate cohesin loading in trans to regulate gene expression.},

We used Sharpr-MPRA to test 4.6 million nucleotides spanning 15,000 putative regulatory regions tiled at 5-nucleotide resolution in two human cell types. Our results recovered known cell-type-specific regulatory motifs and evolutionarily conserved nucleotides, and distinguished known activating and repressive motifs.

  annote = {More SNPs in LD -{$>$} more chi sq statistic - could be because more chance of SNPs tagging a large effect SNP or small effect SNPs adding upto large effect.

If heritability within an annotation is larger, this would be affected more by LD than region where heritability was small.

""Thus, our method determines that a category of SNPs is enriched for heritability if SNPs with high LD to that category have higher {$\chi$}2 statistics than SNPs with low LD to that category.""

Estimated chi sq = N*(per SNP heritability in category)*(LD score of SNP in category) + N*cryptic population stratification/confounders + 1

LD score = defined as sum r2, estimated as sum r2 w/ all other SNPs a 1cM window.

per SNP hertiabitlity can be calculated using multiple regression of chi-sq stats against LD score

Enrichment for heritability~ = proportion of SNP heritability in a category with number of SNPs in that category

standard errors are calulated using jackknife. Standard errors are then used to calculate z scores, p values and FDR

~

- For testing cell type specific annotations (N = 220), they controlled for baseline annotations (big ? 53 annotations contained super enhancers and what not?). To do this, they added the annotations individually to the baseline model.

"we added these annotations individually to the base- line model, creating 220 separate models, each with 54 annotations. Then, for a given phenotype, we ran LD score regression once each on the 220 models and ranked the cell type\textendash{}specific annotations by the P value of the coefficient C of the annotation in the correspond- ing analysis. This P value tests whether the annotation contributes significantly to SNP heritability after controlling for the effects of the annotations in the full baseline model. "

- This has higher power to detect enrichment in larger anontations !!

- Concern that more annotations used makes the enrichment more robust??

- Use of partitioned heritability vs regression coefficients:

Partitioned heritability vs. regression coefficients. The parameters tc and h2(C) have different interpretations. Because h2(C) is defined as the sum of squared effects of SNPs in C, it should not depend on the categories chosen to be in the model, and is generally a robust quantity to estimate. On the other hand, tc is the contribution of cPategory Cc after controlling for all other categories in the model; it is defined by the equation Var(j) = summation tc and depends explicitly on the choice of categories to put in the model.

As a result, h2(Cc) is a more robust quantity, and we report this value as the outcome of our baseline analysis. On the other hand, when comparing cell types, we believe that it is important to control for the overlap of cell-type-specific annotations with other functional categories such as coding. Thus, we rank cell types by the P-value of ⌧c, rather than the P-value of total enrichment, (Prop. h2) / (Prop. SNPs).

- Why use with baseline model would be helpful - this was based on simulations

"In summary, although these simulations include exaggerated patterns of enrichment (for example, where 100\% of heritability is present in DHS-flanking regions), the results highlight the possibility that two-category estimators of enrichment can yield incorrect con- clusions. Although we cannot entirely rule out model misspecification as a source of bias for stratified LD score regression with the full base- line model, we have shown here that this method is robust to a wide variety of patterns of enrichment because including many categories gives it the flexibility to adapt to the unknown causal model."

~

-- From tests running annotation enrichment for Islets and Adipose, we see-

-{$>$} Using only 1 annotation gives highly exaggerated enrichments - this was shown in their simulations. It depends on the categories input. Though the enrichment should not change that much, the t coefficient should change.

-{$>$} Using baseline modes + 1 SE gives Enrichment values different for each trait. Enrichment for different annotations in the baseline model are mostly stable

-{$>$} Using only Islet + Adipose still gives higher enrichment values as compared to enrichments.

-{$>$} Use all SE in the model

-{$>$} Use all chromatin states in the model

-{$>$} Use all chromatin state of one cell type in the model

-{$>$} Use all chromatin states + baseline model}

NKX2-5, a key cardiac development TF, has been associated with electrocardiographic (EKG) traits through GWAS, but the extent to which differential binding of NKX2-5 contributes to these traits has not yet been studied. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data generated from iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines (iPSC-CMs) from seven whole- genome sequenced individuals in a three-generational family. We identified \textasciitilde{}2,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with allele-specific effects (ASE) on NKX2-5 binding. These ASE-SNVs were enriched for altered TF motifs (both cognate and other cardiac TFs), and were positively correlated with changes in H3K27ac in iPSC-CMs, suggesting they impact cardiac enhancer activity. We found that NKX2- 5 ASE-SNVs were significantly enriched for being heart-specific eQTLs and EKG GWAS variants, suggesting that altered NKX2-5 binding at multiple sites across the genome influences EKG traits. We used a fine-mapping approach to integrate iPSC-CM molecular phenotype data with a GWAS for heart rate, and determined that NKX2-5 ASE variants are likely causal for numerous known, as well as previously unidentified, heart rate loci. Analyzing Hi-C and gene expression data from iPSC-CMs at these heart rate loci, we identified several genes likely to be causally involved in heart rate variability. Our study demonstrates that differential binding of NKX2-5 is a common mechanism underlying genetic association with EKG traits, and shows that characterizing variants associated with differential binding of development TFs in iPSC-derived cell lines can identify novel loci and mechanisms influencing complex traits.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility.

  abstract = {Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers represent classes of transcriptional enhancers that have been shown to control the expression of cell identity genes and carry disease- and trait-associated variants. Specifically, super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers defined based on the binding occupancy of master transcription factors (TFs), chromatin regulators, or chromatin marks, while stretch enhancers are large chromatin-defined regulatory regions of at least 3,000 base pairs. Several studies have characterized these regulatory regions in numerous cell types and tissues to decipher their functional importance. However, the differences and similarities between these regulatory regions have not been fully assessed. We integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from ten human cell types to perform a comparative analysis of super and stretch enhancers with respect to their chromatin profiles, cell-type-specificity, and ability to control gene expression. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex and transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85\%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13\%), which are enriched for cell-type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes. These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell-type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers.},

  abstract = {Non-coding gene regulatory enhancers are essential to transcription in mammalian cells. As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis-regulatory enhancer sequences. In practice, most studies consider enhancers identified by only a single method, and the concordance of enhancers identified by different methods has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we assess the similarities of enhancer sets identified by ten representative strategies in four biological contexts and evaluate the robustness of downstream conclusions to the choice of identification strategy. All pairs of enhancer sets we evaluated overlap significantly more than expected by chance; however, we also found significant dissimilarity between enhancer sets in their genomic characteristics, evolutionary conservation, and association with functional loci within each context. We find most regions identified as enhancers are supported by only one method. The disagreement is sufficient to influence interpretation of GWAS SNPs and eQTL, and to lead to disparate conclusions about enhancer biology and disease mechanisms. We also find only limited evidence that regions identified by multiple enhancer identification methods are better candidates than those identified by a single method. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and argue that current approaches have yet to adequately account for enhancer diversity. As a result, we cannot recommend the use of any single enhancer identification strategy in isolation. To facilitate assessment of enhancer diversity on studies' conclusions, we developed creDB, a database of enhancer annotations designed to integrate into bioinformatics workflows. While our findings highlight a major challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease and interpreting regulatory variants found in patient genomes, a systematic understanding of similarities and differences in enhancer identification methodology will ultimately enable robust inferences about gene regulatory sequences.},

Bioinformatically, for inflammatory macrophages we define a unique network of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators (TRs), which was characterized by accessible promoters independent of the activation signal. In contrast to the general accessibility of promoters of TRs, mRNA expression of central TRs belonging to the TR network displayed stimulus-specific expression patterns, indicating a second level of transcriptional regulation beyond epigenetic chromatin changes. In contrast, stringent integration of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation was observed in networks of TRs established from somatic tissues and tissue macrophages. In these networks, clusters of TRs with permissive histone marks were associated with high gene expression whereas clusters with repressive chromatin marks were associated with absent gene expression. Collectively, these results support that macrophage activation during inflammation in contrast to lineage determination is mainly regulated transcriptionally by a pre-defined TR network.},

Histone modifications influence higher-order chromatin structures at individual epigenomic states and chromatin environments to regulate gene expression. However, genome-wide higher-order chromatin structures shaped by different histone modifications remain poorly characterized. With stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we characterized the higher-order chromatin structures at their epigenomic states, categorized into three major types in interphase: histone acetylation marks form spatially segregated nanoclusters, active histone methylation marks form spatially dispersed larger nanodomains, and repressive histone methylation marks form condensed large aggregates. These distinct structural characteristics are also observed in mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, active histone marks coincide with less compact chromatin and exhibit a higher degree of co-localization with other active marks and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), while repressive marks coincide with densely packed chromatin and spatially distant from repressive marks and active RNAP II. Taken together, super-resolution imaging reveals three distinct chromatin structures at various epigenomic states, which may be spatially coordinated to impact transcription.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1756-8935},
  abstract = {Background
Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation involves major biochemical and structural changes. In order to elucidate the role of gene regulatory changes during this process, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the complete transcriptome and epigenome of human monocytes that were differentiated in vitro by addition of colony-stimulating factor 1 in serum-free medium.

Results
Numerous mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly up- or down-regulated. More than 100 discrete DNA regions, most often far away from transcription start sites, were rapidly demethylated by the ten eleven translocation enzymes, became nucleosome-free and gained histone marks indicative of active enhancers. These regions were unique for macrophages and associated with genes involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, phagocytosis and innate immune response.

Conclusions
In summary, we have discovered a phagocytic gene network that is repressed by DNA methylation in monocytes and rapidly de-repressed after the onset of macrophage differentiation.

  abstract = {Structured Abstract
Introduction Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for up to 3 to 5 days. Concomitantly, immunological imprinting of either tolerance (immunosuppression) or trained immunity (innate immune memory) determines the functional fate of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, as observed after infection or vaccination.
The epigenome, DNase I accessibility, and transcriptome were characterized in purified human circulating monocytes, in vitro differentiated na{\"i}ve, tolerized (immunosuppression), and trained macrophages (innate immune memory). This allowed the identification of pathways functionally implicated in innate immune memory. This epigenetic signature of human monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and monocyte training generates hypotheses to understand and manipulate medically relevant immune conditions.
Methods Purified circulating monocytes from healthy volunteers were differentiated under the homeostatic macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations present in human serum. During the first 24 hours, trained immunity was induced by {$\beta$}-glucan (BG) priming, and postsepsis immunoparalysis was mimicked by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), generating endotoxin-induced tolerance. Epigenomic profiling of the histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac, DNase I accessibility, and RNA sequencing were performed at both the start of the experiment (ex vivo monocytes) and at the end of the 6 days of in vitro culture (macrophages).
Results Compared with monocytes (Mo), na{\"i}ve macrophages (Mf ) display a remodeled metabolic enzyme repertoire and attenuated innate inflammatory pathways, most likely necessary to generate functional tissue macrophages. Epigenetic profiling uncovered about 8000 dynamic regions associated with about 11,000 DNase I hypersensitive sites. Changes in histone acetylation identified most dynamic events. Furthermore, these regions of differential histone marks displayed some degree of DNase I accessibility that was already present in monocytes. H3K4me1 mark increased in parallel with de novo H3K27ac deposition at distal regulatory regions; H3K4me1 mark remained even after the loss of H3K27ac, marking decommissioned regulatory elements. {$\beta$}-glucan priming specifically induced about 3000 distal regulatory elements, whereas LPS tolerization induced H3K27ac at about 500 distal regulatory regions. At the transcriptional level, we identified coregulated gene modules during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, as well as discordant modules between trained and tolerized cells. These indicate that training likely involves an increased expression of modules expressed in na{\"i}ve macrophages, including genes that code for metabolic enzymes. On the other hand, endotoxin tolerance involves gene modules that are more active in monocytes than in na{\"i}ve macrophages. About 12\% of known human transcription factors display variation in expression during macrophage differentiation, training, and tolerance. We also observed transcription factor motifs in DNase I hypersensitive sites at condition-specific dynamic epigenomic regions, implying that specific transcription factors are required for trained and tolerized macrophage epigenetic and transcriptional programs. Finally, our analyses and functional validation indicate that the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation blocked trained immunity in vitro and during an in vivo model of lethal Candida albicans infection, abolishing the protective effects of trained immunity.
Discussion We documented the importance of epigenetic regulation of the immunological pathways underlying monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and trained immunity. These dynamic epigenetic elements may inform on potential pharmacological targets that modulate innate immunity. Altogether, we uncovered the epigenetic and transcriptional programs of monocyte differentiation to macrophages that distinguish tolerant and trained macrophage phenotypes, providing a resource to further understand and manipulate immune-mediated responses.
A BLUEPRINT of immune cell development
To determine the epigenetic mechanisms that direct blood cells to develop into the many components of our immune system, the BLUEPRINT consortium examined the regulation of DNA and RNA transcription to dissect the molecular traits that govern blood cell differentiation. By inducing immune responses, Saeed et al. document the epigenetic changes in the genome that underlie immune cell differentiation. Cheng et al. demonstrate that trained monocytes are highly dependent on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of oxygen, which allows cells to produce the energy needed to mount an immune response. Chen et al. examine RNA transcripts and find that specific cell lineages use RNA transcripts of different length and composition (isoforms) to form proteins. Together, the studies reveal how epigenetic effects can drive the development of blood cells involved in the immune system.

Monocyte differentiation into macrophages represents a cornerstone process for host defense. Concomitantly, immunological imprinting of either tolerance or trained immunity determines the functional fate of macrophages and susceptibility to secondary infections. We characterized the transcriptomes and epigenomes in four primary cell types: monocytes and in vitro\textendash{}differentiated na{\"i}ve, tolerized, and trained macrophages. Inflammatory and metabolic pathways were modulated in macrophages, including decreased inflammasome activation, and we identified pathways functionally implicated in trained immunity. {$\beta$}-glucan training elicits an exclusive epigenetic signature, revealing a complex network of enhancers and promoters. Analysis of transcription factor motifs in deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive sites at cell-type\textendash{}specific epigenetic loci unveiled differentiation and treatment-specific repertoires. Altogether, we provide a resource to understand the epigenetic changes that underlie innate immunity in humans.

Macrophage activation is associated with profound transcriptional reprogramming. Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processes~remain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages.

  volume = {86},
  issn = {0896-6273},
  abstract = {Summary
Depression risk is exacerbated by genetic factors and stress exposure; however, the biological mechanisms through which these factors interact to confer depression risk are poorly understood. One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements modulate the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders. Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain.

  abstract = {Rhinovirus (RV) is the most prevalent human respiratory virus and is responsible for at least half of all common colds. RV infections may result in a broad spectrum of effects that range from asymptomatic infections to severe lower respiratory illnesses. The basis for inter-individual variation in the response to RV infection is not well understood. In this study, we explored whether host genetic variation is associated with variation in gene expression response to RV infections between individuals. To do so, we obtained genome-wide genotype and gene expression data in uninfected and RV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 98 individuals. We mapped local and distant genetic variation that is associated with inter-individual differences in gene expression levels (eQTLs) in both uninfected and RV-infected cells. We focused specifically on response eQTLs (reQTLs), namely, genetic associations with inter-individual variation in gene expression response to RV infection. We identified local reQTLs for 38 genes, including genes with known functions in viral response (UBA7, OAS1, IRF5) and genes that have been associated with immune and RV-related diseases (e.g., ITGA2, MSR1, GSTM3). The putative regulatory regions of genes with reQTLs were enriched for binding sites of virus-activated STAT2, highlighting the role of condition-specific transcription factors in genotype-by-environment interactions. Overall, we suggest that the 38 loci associated with inter-individual variation in gene expression response to RV-infection represent promising candidates for affecting immune and RV-related respiratory diseases.},

The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.},

We report the generation and comparative analysis of genome-wide chromatin state maps, PPAR{$\gamma$} and CTCF localization maps, and gene expression profiles from murine and human models of adipogenesis. The data provide high-resolution views of chromatin remodeling during cellular differentiation and allow identification of thousands of putative preadipocyte- and adipocyte-specific cis-regulatory elements based on dynamic chromatin signatures. We find that the specific locations of most such elements differ between the two models, including at orthologous loci with similar expression patterns. Based on sequence analysis and reporter assays, we show that these differences are determined, in part, by evolutionary turnover of transcription factor motifs in the genome sequences and that this turnover may be facilitated by the presence of multiple distal regulatory elements at adipogenesis-dependent loci. We also utilize the close relationship between open chromatin marks and transcription factor motifs to identify and validate PLZF and SRF as regulators of adipogenesis.},

  abstract = {KLF11 (TIEG2) is a pancreas-enriched transcription factor that has elicited significant attention because of its role as negative regulator of exocrine cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, its functional role in the endocrine pancreas remains to be established. Here, we report, for the first time, to our knowledge, the characterization of KLF11 as a glucose-inducible regulator of the insulin gene. A combination of random oligonucleotide binding, EMSA, luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays shows that KLF11 binds to the insulin promoter and regulates its activity in beta cells. Genetic analysis of the KLF11 gene revealed two rare variants (Ala347Ser and Thr220Met) that segregate with diabetes in families with early-onset type 2 diabetes, and significantly impair its transcriptional activity. In addition, analysis of 1,696 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 1,776 normoglycemic subjects show a frequent polymorphic Gln62Arg variant that significantly associates with type 2 diabetes mellitus in North European populations (OR = 1.29, P = 0.00033). Moreover, this variant alters the corepressor mSin3A-binding activity of KLF11, impairs the activation of the insulin promoter and shows lower levels of insulin expression in pancreatic beta cells. In addition, subjects carrying the Gln62Arg allele show decreased plasma insulin after an oral glucose challenge. Interestingly, all three nonsynonymous KLF11 variants show increased repression of the catalase 1 promoter, suggesting a role in free radical clearance that may render beta cells more sensitive to oxidative stress. Thus, both functional and genetic analyses reveal that KLF11 plays a role in the regulation of pancreatic beta cell physiology, and its variants may contribute to the development of diabetes.},

Here, we show that KLF11, an SP/Kr{\"u}ppel-like (SP/KLF) transcription factor, mutated in French maturity onset diabetes of the young patients (MODY7), regulates Pdx-1 transcription in {$\beta$} cells through two evolutionarily conserved GC-rich motifs in conserved Area II, a control region essential to islet {$\beta$} cell-enriched expression. These regulatory elements, termed GC1 (human base pair -2061/-2055) and GC2 (-2036/-2027), are also nearly identical to the consensus KLF11 binding sequence defined here by random oligonucleotide binding analysis. KLF11 specifically associates with Area II in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, while preventing binding to GC1- and/or GC2-compromised Pdx1-driven reporter activity in {$\beta$} cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that KLF11 interacts with the coactivator p300 via its zinc finger domain in vivo to mediate Pdx-1 activation. Together, our data identified a hierarchical regulatory cascade for these two MODY genes, suggesting that gene regulation in MODY is more complex than anticipated previously. Furthermore, because KLF11 like most MODY-associated transcription factors uses p300, these data further support a role for this coactivator as a critical chromatin link in forms of type 2 diabetes.},

  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {Background
HOT (high-occupancy target) regions, which are bound by a surprisingly large number of transcription factors, are considered to be among the most intriguing findings of recent years. An improved understanding of the roles that HOT regions play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying HOT regions across the spectrum of human cell types.

Results
We characterised and validated HOT regions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and produced a catalogue of HOT regions in a broad range of human cell types. We found that HOT regions are associated with genes that control and define the developmental processes of the respective cell and tissue types. We also showed evidence of the developmental persistence of HOT regions at primitive enhancers and demonstrate unique signatures of HOT regions that distinguish them from typical enhancers and super-enhancers. Finally, we performed a dynamic analysis to reveal the dynamical regulation of HOT regions upon H1 differentiation.

Conclusions
Taken together, our results provide a resource for the functional exploration of HOT regions and extend our understanding of the key roles of HOT regions in development and differentiation.

However, few studies have linked cis-regulatory variation with adaptation in natural populations. Here, using a combination of exome and RNA-seq data, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and allele-specific expression analyses to study the genetic architecture of regulatory variation in wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) using individuals from five populations collected along a latitudinal cline in eastern North America. Mice in this transect showed clinal patterns of variation in several traits, including body mass. Mice were larger in more northern latitudes, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We identified 17 genes where cis-eQTL were clinal outliers and for which expression level was correlated with latitude. Among these clinal outliers, we identified two genes (Adam17 and Bcat2) with cis-eQTL that were associated with adaptive body mass variation and for which expression was correlated with body mass both within and between populations. Finally, we performed a gene co-expression network analysis to identify expression modules associated with measures of body size variation in these mice. These findings demonstrate the power of combining gene expression data with scans for selection to identify genes involved in adaptive phenotypic evolution and also provide strong evidence for cis-regulatory elements as essential loci of environmental adaptation in natural populations.},

  abstract = {Early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, the most significant genetic variants contribute only a small fraction of the estimated heritability. Instead, it has become clear that a huge number of common variants, each with tiny effects, explain most of the heritability. Previously, we argued that these patterns conflict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated - as seems likely - then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes. Thus our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.},

IntroductionVariation in an individual's response to environmental factors is likely to influence susceptibility to complex human diseases. The genetic basis of such variation is poorly understood. Here, we identify natural genetic variants that underlie variation in the host innate immune response to infection and analyze the mechanisms by which such variants alter these responses.
{$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/343/6175/1246980/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Identifying the genetic basis of variability in the host response to pathogens. A cohort of 534 individuals donated blood for (a) genotyping of common DNA variants and (b) isolation of immune DCs. DCs were stimulated with viral and bacterial components, and the variability in individuals' gene expression responses was mapped to specific DNA variants, which were then shown to affect binding of particular transcription factors.
MethodsWe derived dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral blood monocytes of healthy individuals (295 Caucasians, 122 African Americans, 117 East Asians) and stimulated them with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), influenza virus, or the cytokine interferon-{$\beta$} (IFN-{$\beta$}) to generate 1598 transcriptional profiles. We genotyped each of these individuals at sites of common genetic variation and identified the genetic variants that best explain variation in gene expression and gene induction between individuals. We then tested mechanistic predictions from these associations using synthetic promoter constructs and genome engineering.
ResultsWe identified 264 loci containing genetic variants associated with variation in absolute gene expression in human DCs, of which 121 loci were associated with variation in the induction of gene expression by one or more stimuli. Fine-mapping identified candidate causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with expression variance, and deeper functional experiments localized three of these SNPs to the binding sites of stimulus-activated transcription factors. We also identified a cis variant in the transcription factor, IRF7, associated in trans with the induction of a module of antiviral genes in response to influenza infection. Of the identified genetic variants, 35 were also associated with autoimmune or infectious disease loci found by genome-wide association studies.
DiscussionThe genetic variants we uncover and the molecular basis for their action provide mechanistic explanations and principles for how the innate immune response to pathogens and cytokines varies across individuals. Our results also link disease-associated variants to specific immune pathways in DCs, which provides greater insight into mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes. Extending our approach to many immune cell types and pathways will provide a global map linking human genetic variants to specific immunological processes.
Immune Variation
It is difficult to determine the mechanistic consequences of context-dependent genetic variants, some of which may be related to disease (see the Perspective by Gregersen). Two studies now report on the effects of stimulating immunological monocytes and dendritic cells with proteins that can elicit a response to bacterial or viral infection and assess the functional links between genetic variants and profiles of gene expression. M. N. Lee et al. (10.1126/science.1246980) analyzed the expression of more than 400 genes, in dendritic cells from 534 healthy subjects, which revealed how expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) affect gene expression within the interferon-{$\beta$} and the Toll-like receptor 3 and 4 pathways. Fairfax et al. (10.1126/science.1246949) performed a genome-wide analysis to show that many eQTLs affected monocyte gene expression in a stimulus- or time-specific manner.
Little is known about how human genetic variation affects the responses to environmental stimuli in the context of complex diseases. Experimental and computational approaches were applied to determine the effects of genetic variation on the induction of pathogen-responsive genes in human dendritic cells. We identified 121 common genetic variants associated in cis with variation in expression responses to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, influenza, or interferon-{$\beta$} (IFN-{$\beta$}). We localized and validated causal variants to binding sites of pathogen-activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and IRF (IFN-regulatory factor) transcription factors. We also identified a common variant in IRF7 that is associated in trans with type I IFN induction in response to influenza infection. Our results reveal common alleles that explain interindividual variation in pathogen sensing and provide functional annotation for genetic variants that alter susceptibility to inflammatory diseases.

IntroductionThe activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by antigen initiates adaptive immune responses, amplifying rare antigen-specific clones and leading to functional specialization of effector T cells, in particular through the spectrum of cytokines they produce. Pathogens have exerted selective pressure during recent human evolution and migrations, but selection for a type of response that is optimal against one microbe class could carry a price in less-effective responses to other microbes or in impaired self-tolerance and autoimmune disease. Little is known about interindividual variation in the responsiveness of human CD4+ T cells and how genetic variation affects the tone and intensity of T cell responses in human individuals.
{$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/345/6202/1254665/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Characterizing the variation in T cell response. A total of 348 individuals from the ImmVar cohort donated blood for CD4+ T cell isolation and genotyping. The T cells were subsequently activated to mimic the recognition of the cognate antigen. The variability in adaptive immune response, which may have genetic and nongenetic components, was characterized by profiling the response of activated T cells. A computational analysis uncovered genetic drivers for this variation and pinpointed molecular mechanisms by which they may act.
RationaleAs the third arm of the ImmVar project, we performed a rigorously controlled analysis of the responses of human blood CD4+ T cells to activation in unbiased conditions or in a culture regimen that promotes differentiation to the T helper 17 cell (TH17) phenotype. To permit an appreciation of the breadth of variation across humans, we investigated these responses in a cohort of 348 healthy human volunteers representing three different ancestries (African, Asian, and European). Responses to activation were evaluated by gene expression profiling, focused on the transcripts that best represent the response, its variability, and its functional consequences. Relating these data to dense single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes from the participants, we identified the genetic contributions to this variation by using heritability analysis and fine-mapped previously unknown expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that control these responses by using trans-ethnic meta-analysis.
ResultsWe observed a high degree of interindividual variability, much of which was reproducible for a given subject. This variability followed complex patterns and did not reduce simply to dominant TH1, 2, or 17 types. We identified 39 loci associated in cis with gene activation in T cells. These explained on average 25\% of the repeatable variation, but a major element could not be ascribed to simple genetic effects, instead reflecting environmental influences, immunologic history, or complex integration of network regulation. Of activation-induced genes, cytokines showed the most variability, but with little or no cis genetic control, in contrast to cytokine receptors, which were less variable but for which several eQTLs were detected. Ancestry of the donors markedly influenced T cell responses, with stronger TH17 being associated with African descent. We fine-mapped and validated experimentally a single-base variant that modulates binding of the transcription factor YY1 and hence the activity of an enhancer element controlling the autoimmune-associated IL2RA gene, affecting its activity in activated but not regulatory T cells.
ConclusionEchoing the linked ImmVar studies, we find that the relevant cell type and context are essential for discovering the genetic drivers of cell-specific responses and of connected autoinflammatory diseases. Our study lays the groundwork for further explorations into the relative contributions of genes and their environment on immunological processes, which should aid in our understanding of autoimmune disease and its genetic underpinnings.
Response to pathogens is in the genes
T cells are important in mounting immune responses to a host of pathogens, and they have also been implicated in autoimmune disease. By examining the variability in gene expression in stimulated T cells over time from a multi-ethnic cohort of healthy humans, Ye et al. identified specific genetic polymorphisms that explain differences among individuals in response to pathogens. Furthermore, a candidate gene approach led to the identification of a single-nucleotide polymorphism that controls the response of the autoimmune-associated IL2RA gene. This study helps us understand the degree to which immune responses are driven by the environment or by an individual's physiological or genetic factors.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1254665
T lymphocyte activation by antigen conditions adaptive immune responses and immunopathologies, but we know little about its variation in humans and its genetic or environmental roots. We analyzed gene expression in CD4+ T cells during unbiased activation or in T helper 17 (TH17) conditions from 348 healthy participants representing European, Asian, and African ancestries. We observed interindividual variability, most marked for cytokine transcripts, with clear biases on the basis of ancestry, and following patterns more complex than simple TH1/2/17 partitions. We identified 39 genetic loci specifically associated in cis with activated gene expression. We further fine-mapped and validated a single-base variant that modulates YY1 binding and the activity of an enhancer element controlling the autoimmune-associated IL2RA gene, affecting its activity in activated but not regulatory T cells. Thus, interindividual variability affects the fundamental immunologic process of T helper activation, with important connections to autoimmune disease.
Profiles of T cell responses display genetically influenced interindividual variation.

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem. One-third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the etiological agent causing TB, and active disease kills nearly 2 million individuals worldwide every year. Several lines of evidence indicate that interindividual variation in susceptibility to TB has a heritable component, yet we still know little about the underlying genetic architecture. To address this, we performed a genome-wide mapping study of loci that are associated with functional variation in immune response to MTB. Specifically, we characterized transcript and protein expression levels and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in primary dendritic cells (DCs) from 65 individuals, before and after infection with MTB. We found 198 response eQTL, namely loci that were associated with variation in gene expression levels in either untreated or MTB-infected DCs, but not both. These response eQTL are associated with natural regulatory variation that likely affects (directly or indirectly) host interaction with MTB. Indeed, when we integrated our data with results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for pulmonary TB, we found that the response eQTL were more likely to be genetically associated with the disease. We thus identified a number of candidate loci, including the MAPK phosphatase DUSP14 in particular, that are promising susceptibility genes to pulmonary TB.},

  abstract = {Summary
Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of~9.3\% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes, more than 75\% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are key to controlling infection.},

  abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

We identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1\textendash{}3\% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that only 0.15\% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism.

Here, we investigate the geographic clustering of genetic variants that influence complex traits and disease risk in a sample of \textasciitilde{}450,000 individuals from Great Britain. Out of 30 traits analyzed, 16 show significant geographic clustering at the genetic level after controlling for ancestry, likely reflecting recent migration driven by socio-economic status (SES). Alleles associated with educational attainment (EA) show most clustering, with EA-decreasing alleles clustering in lower SES areas such as coal mining areas. Individuals that leave coal mining areas carry more EA-increasing alleles on average than the rest of Great Britain. In addition, we leveraged the geographic clustering of complex trait variation to further disentangle regional differences in socio-economic and cultural outcomes through genome-wide association studies on publicly available regional measures, namely coal mining, religiousness, 1970/2015 general election outcomes, and Brexit referendum results.},

However, applicability in all ethnic groups is lacking. Challenges remain in the classification of genes as diabetes-causing and the interpretation of genetic variants at the clinical interface.SummarySince the discovery that genetic defects can cause neonatal or young-onset diabetes, multiple causal genes have been identified and there have been many advances in strategies to detect genetic forms of diabetes and their treatments.

  abstract = {Insulin resistance is necessary but not sufficient for the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes results when pancreatic beta-cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production through an expansion of beta-cell mass or increased insulin secretion. Communication between insulin target tissues and beta-cells may initiate this compensatory response. Correlated changes in gene expression between tissues can provide evidence for such intercellular communication. We profiled gene expression in six tissues of mice from an obesity-induced diabetes-resistant and a diabetes-susceptible strain before and after the onset of diabetes. We studied the correlation structure of mRNA abundance and identified 105 co-expression gene modules. We provide an interactive gene network model showing the correlation structure between the expression modules within and among the six tissues. This resource also provides a searchable database of gene expression profiles for all genes in six tissues in lean and obese diabetes-resistant and diabetes-susceptible mice, at 4 and 10 wk of age. A cell cycle regulatory module in islets predicts diabetes susceptibility. The module predicts islet replication; we found a strong correlation between 2H2O incorporation into islet DNA in vivo and the expression pattern of the cell cycle module. This pattern is highly correlated with that of several individual genes in insulin target tissues, including Igf2, which has been shown to promote beta-cell proliferation, suggesting that these genes may provide a link between insulin resistance and beta-cell proliferation.},

  issn = {1432-0428},
  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Most type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants identified via genome-wide association studies (GWASs) appear to act via the pancreatic islet. Observed defects in insulin secretion could result from an impact of these variants on islet development and/or the function of mature islets. Most functional studies have focused on the latter, given limitations regarding access to human fetal islet tissue. Capitalising upon advances in in vitro differentiation, we characterised the transcriptomes of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines differentiated along the pancreatic endocrine lineage, and explored the contribution of altered islet development to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: We performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of human iPSC lines from three independent donors, at baseline and at seven subsequent stages during in vitro islet differentiation. Differentially expressed genes (q\,{$<$}\,0.01, log2 fold change [FC]\,{$>$}\,1) were assigned to the stages at which they were most markedly upregulated. We used these data to characterise upstream transcription factors directing different stages of development, and to explore the relationship between RNA expression profiles and genes mapping to type 2 diabetes GWAS signals.
RESULTS: We identified 9409 differentially expressed genes across all stages, including many known markers of islet development. Integration of differential expression data with information on transcription factor motifs highlighted the potential contribution of REST to islet development. Over 70\% of genes mapping within type 2 diabetes-associated credible intervals showed peak differential expression during islet development, and type 2 diabetes GWAS loci of largest effect (including TCF7L2; log2FC\,=\,1.2; q\,=~8.5\,\texttimes\,10-10) were notably enriched in genes differentially expressed at the posterior foregut stage (q\,=\,0.002), as calculated by gene set enrichment analyses. In a complementary analysis of enrichment, genes differentially expressed in the final, beta-like cell stage of in vitro differentiation were significantly enriched (hypergeometric test, permuted p value {$<$}0.05) for genes within the credible intervals of type 2 diabetes GWAS loci.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study characterises RNA expression profiles during human islet differentiation, identifies potential transcriptional regulators of the differentiation process, and suggests that the inherited predisposition to type 2 diabetes is partly mediated through modulation of islet development.

  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {In pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, it has been reported that higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated with increased risk of a silent cerebral infarction (SCI). SCI is a major cause of neurologic morbidity in children with SCD, and blood pressure is a potential modulator of clinical manifestations of SCD; however, the risk factors underlying these complications are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that influence SBP in an African American population in the setting of SCD, and explore the use of SBP as an endo-phenotype for SCI. We conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis for SBP using two SCD cohorts, as well as a candidate screen based on published SBP loci. A total of 1,617 patients were analyzed, and while no SNP reached genome-wide significance (P-value{$<$}5.0x10-8), a number of suggestive candidate loci were identified. The most significant SNP, rs7952106 (P-value=8.57x10-7), was in the DRD2 locus on chromosome 11. In a gene-based association analysis, MIR4301 (micro-RNA4301), which resides in an intron of DRD2, was the most significant gene (P-value=5.2x10-5). Examining 27 of the previously reported SBP associated SNPs, 4 SNPs were nominally significant. A genetic risk score was constructed to assess the aggregated genetic effect of the published SBP variants, demonstrating a significant association (P=0.05). In addition, we also assessed whether these variants are associated with SCI, validating the use of SBP as an endo-phenotype for SCI. Three SNPs were nominally associated, and only rs2357790 (5' CACNB2) was significant for both SBP and SCI. None of these SNPs retained significance after Bonferroni correction. Taken together, our results suggest the importance of DRD2 genetic variation in the modulation of SBP, and extend the aggregated importance of previously reported SNPs in the modulation of SBP in an African American cohort, more specifically in children with SCD.},

  abstract = {LY2409021 is a glucagon receptor antagonist that was associated with hepatic steatosis and elevated aminotransferases in phase 2 diabetes studies. We investigated the relationship between selected genetic variants and hepatic steatosis and elevated alanine aminotransferases (ALTs) associated with LY2409021. Patients participated in a 6-week placebo-controlled trial (I1R-MC-GLDI [GLDI], n = 246) and a 52-week placebo- and active comparator-controlled trial (I1R-MC-GLDJ [GLDJ], n = 158). GLDJ had endpoints at 6 months, including measures of hepatic fat fraction (HFF) by magnetic resonance imaging. The five genes tested were patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) (rs738409 and rs738491), transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) (rs58542926), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) (rs4361373, rs3774921, rs2970849), adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) (rs713586), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (rs1520220). In GLDI, PNPLA3 I148M (P = 0.001) and TM6SF2 E167K (P = 0.001) were significantly associated with an increase in ALT at 6 weeks for LY2409021 but not for placebo. In GLDJ, PNPLA3 I148M showed the same effect (P = 0.007) on ALT at 6 months but the placebo or sitagliptin did not. In GLDJ, both PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 risk-allele carriers showed increases in HFF that were numerically greater but not statistically significant. The carriers of PNPLA3 and/or TM6SF2 risk alleles showed significantly increased ALT (GLDI, +13.28 U/L in carriers versus +4.84 U/L in noncarriers, P = 4 \texttimes{} 10\textendash{}5; GLDJ, +14.6 U/L in carriers versus +1.7 in noncarriers, P = 0.0018) and HFF (GLDJ, +5.35\% in carriers versus 2.38\% in noncarriers, P = 0.048). Elevation of transaminase and HFF were also noted in the noncarriers but at a significantly lower degree. Conclusion: The carriers of PNPLA3 and/or TM6SF2 variant alleles are at risk for hepatic steatosis and elevated ALT levels caused by LY2409021, a glucagon receptor antagonist. More studies are needed to investigate if our observations are generalizable to hepatic steatosis caused by other medications. (Hepatology Communications 2018;2:561-570)},

  abstract = {Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is complex, with marked inter-individual variability in disease severity. The clinical heterogeneity of SCD is largely influenced by genetic factors, including several well-established modifiers of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels within the beta globin locus, BCL11A, and HBS1L-MYB genes. However, little is known about genetic factors that may influence variability in treatment response, particularly in clinical trials assessing potential therapeutic agents for SCD. The DOVE (Determining Effects of Platelet Inhibition on Vaso-Occlusive Events) study was a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent prasugrel for the reduction of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in children with sickle cell anemia (NCT01794000). Although the primary endpoint of reduction of rate of VOC did not reach statistical significance in the DOVE trial in the ITT population, a treatment effect of prasugrel was suggested in certain subgroups. The objective of this study was to evaluate candidate genetic variants with SCD severity and to assess impact of these variants on response to prasugrel, as measured by the frequency of VOC (composite of painful crisis and acute chest syndrome events) during the study period of up to 24 months.
Methods: De-identified dried blood spot samples were collected for genetic analyses as per informed consent and study protocol. Genomic DNA was extracted from a 3 mm Whatman FTA card punch using Qiagen QIAamp DNA kit. A total of 313 (92\%) DOVE patients (Hb SS or Hb S/{$\beta$}0 thalassemia) were genotyped using the TaqMan assay. After quality control, 253 patients and 28 variants were considered for genetic evaluation. These variants have been reported to be associated with SCD and/or its related comorbidities. All variants were analyzed for VOC in the prasugrel and placebo groups separately and for treatment by variant interactions in the overall study population. Variants were also assessed in the overall study population for associations with a hemolytic score, derived from 5 biomarkers of hemolysis and baseline hematologic markers including leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, and red cell mean corpuscular volume. All analyses were conducted using additive multivariate regression framework as the main model and were adjusted for age, race, geographic region, and hydroxyurea (HU) use at baseline. In addition, genotypic, dominant, and recessive models were evaluated as supportive analyses.
Results: Two variants, rs7482144, located in the 5'- HBG2 gene promoter (-158 Xmn1) on chr 11 and rs1427407, located in the BCL11A gene on chr 2, were associated with VOC and a treatment interaction effect of prasugrel. HBG2 rs7482144, was associated with a significant decrease in frequency of VOC in prasugrel-treated patients relative to placebo (adjusted p=0.0065). The BCL11A rs1427407 variant was associated with an increase in VOC in prasugrel-treated patients relative to placebo (adjusted p=0.0205).
No genetic associations were found with baseline composite hemolytic score in the overall population. However, significant associations with KLF-1, HBG2, and HBE variants were observed with individual hematologic markers. The KLF-1 variant (rs112631212) was associated with lower leukocyte (p{$<$}0.0001) and neutrophil (p=0.0002) counts in the subgroup of participants on HU; whereas the HBG2 (rs2070972; p=0.0116) and HBE (rs3834466 and rs7130110; p=0.0274 and p=0.0340 respectively) variants were associated with elevated platelet counts in the overall group.
Conclusions: Given the study sample size, this study highlights the significance of HBG2 and BCL11A variants for the frequency of VOC in prasugrel-treated patients versus placebo. These variants have been reported in association with HbF/F-cells, an ameliorating factor for VOC that is only partly explained by endogenous levels of HbF. Our findings suggest that these variants may have contributed to the treatment-related effects of prasugrel on VOC outcomes in the DOVE trial. Identifying such genetic variants that are associated with differential response to treatment may help guide selection of patients for clinical trials based on predicted risk of VOC.

  abstract = {A case\textendash{}control study often compares the prevalence of a specific disease among persons with normal alleles and persons with variant alleles, which generates an odds ratio (OR). The most common type of allele variation, single-nucleotide polymorphism, consists of a major allele (M) and a minor allele (m). Thus, the genotype can be a major allele homozygote (MM), a heterozygote (Mm) or a minor allele homozygote (mm). Odds are given for each genotype, and a pair of odds generates an OR. Summarizing data using two-by-two contingency is the simplest method of estimating an OR. Thus, dominant, multiplicative, recessive, and over-dominant models are often used. Traditionally, researchers used to calculate ORs using many models and then select the best model from among these calculated ORs. This may cause problems due to multiple comparisons. Therefore, we should choose the best model before calculating the OR for each model. In this article, we will discuss how to choose the best model among many subject-level models when evaluating the impact of the MM/Mm/mm genotype on the disease prevalence.},

  abstract = {Insulin from the {$\beta$}-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans controls energy homeostasis in vertebrates, and its deficiency causes diabetes mellitus. During embryonic development, the transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) initiates the differentiation of the {$\beta$}-cells and other islet cell types from pancreatic endoderm, but the genetic program that subsequently completes this differentiation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Rfx6 directs islet cell differentiation downstream of Neurog3. Mice lacking Rfx6 failed to generate any of the normal islet cell types except for pancreatic-polypeptide-producing cells. In human infants with a similar autosomal recessive syndrome of neonatal diabetes, genetic mapping and subsequent sequencing identified mutations in the human RFX6 gene. These studies demonstrate a unique position for Rfx6 in the hierarchy of factors that coordinate pancreatic islet development in both mice and humans. Rfx6 could prove useful in efforts to generate {$\beta$}-cells for patients with diabetes.},

In all, eight cases have been reported, with the age at onset of diabetes in the first 2 weeks of life. Here we report two individuals born to double first cousins in whom intestinal atresias consistent with a diagnosis of Mitchell\textendash{}Riley syndrome were diagnosed at birth, but in whom diabetes did not present until the ages of 3 and 6 years. Novel compound heterozygous RFX6 nonsense mutations (p.Arg726X/p.Arg866X) were identified at the 3{${'}$} end of the gene. The later onset of diabetes in these patients may be due to incomplete inactivation of RFX6. Genetic testing for RFX6 mutations should be considered in patients presenting with intestinal atresias in the absence of neonatal diabetes.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that loss of {$\beta$} cell characteristics may cause insulin secretory deficiency in~diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that Rfx6, whose mutation leads to neonatal diabetes in humans, is essential to maintain key features of functionally mature {$\beta$} cells in mice. Rfx6 loss in adult {$\beta$} cells leads to glucose intolerance, impaired {$\beta$} cell glucose sensing, and defective insulin secretion. This is associated with reduced expression of core components of the insulin secretion pathway, including glucokinase, the Abcc8/SUR1 subunit of KATP channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which are direct targets of Rfx6. Moreover, Rfx6 contributes to the silencing of the vast majority of ``disallowed'' genes, a group usually specifically repressed in adult {$\beta$} cells, and thus to the maintenance of {$\beta$} cell maturity. These findings raise the possibility that changes in Rfx6 expression or activity may contribute to {$\beta$} cell failure in humans.,

  abstract = {Summary
Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that consist of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains (ADs). The DBDs have been well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms by which ADs effect gene activation. Here, we report that diverse ADs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator. For the OCT4 and GCN4 TFs, we show that the ability to form phase-separated droplets with Mediator in~vitro and the ability to activate genes~in~vivo are dependent on the same amino acid residues. For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation. These results suggest that diverse TFs can interact with Mediator through the phase-separating capacity of their ADs and that formation of condensates with Mediator is involved in gene activation.},

While many genetic variants have been associated with risk for human diseases, how these variants affect gene expression in various cell types remains largely unknown. To address this gap, the DICE (database of immune cell expression, expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs], and epigenomics) project was established. Considering all human immune cell types and conditions studied, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, which represent 61\% of all protein-coding genes expressed in these cell types. Strikingly, a large fraction (41\%) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type. We also found that biological sex is associated with major differences in immune cell gene expression in a highly cell-specific manner. These datasets will help reveal the effects of disease risk-associated genetic polymorphisms on specific immune cell types, providing mechanistic insights into how they might influence pathogenesis (https://dice-database.org).},

  title = {Genome-Wide Comparative Analysis Reveals Human-Mouse Regulatory Landscape and Evolution},
  volume = {16},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {Background
Because species-specific gene expression is driven by species-specific regulation, understanding the relationship between sequence and function of the regulatory regions in different species will help elucidate how differences among species arise. Despite active experimental and computational research, relationships among sequence, conservation, and function are still poorly understood.

Results
We compared transcription factor occupied segments (TFos) for 116 human and 35 mouse TFs in 546 human and 125 mouse cell types and tissues from the Human and the Mouse ENCODE projects. We based the map between human and mouse TFos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper, bnMapper, that utilizes whole genome alignments (WGA)., Our analysis shows that TFos are under evolutionary constraint, but a substantial portion (25.1\% of mouse and 25.85\% of human on average) of the TFos does not have a homologous sequence on the other species; this portion varies among cell types and TFs. Furthermore, 47.67\% and 57.01\% of the homologous TFos sequence shows binding activity on the other species for human and mouse respectively. However, 79.87\% and 69.22\% is repurposed such that it binds the same TF in different cells or different TFs in the same cells. Remarkably, within the set of repurposed TFos, the corresponding genome regions in the other species are preferred locations of novel TFos. These events suggest exaptation of some functional regulatory sequences into new function., Despite TFos repurposing, we did not find substantial changes in their predicted target genes, suggesting that CRMs buffer evolutionary events allowing little or no change in the TFos \textendash{} target gene associations. Thus, the small portion of TFos with strictly conserved occupancy underestimates the degree of conservation of regulatory interactions.

Conclusion
We mapped regulatory sequences from an extensive number of TFs and cell types between human and mouse using WGA. A comparative analysis of this correspondence unveiled the extent of the shared regulatory sequence across TFs and cell types under study. Importantly, a large part of the shared regulatory sequence is repurposed on the other species. This sequence, fueled by turnover events, provides a strong case for exaptation in regulatory elements.

In order to understand cellular differentiation, it is important to understand the timing of the regulation of gene expression. Arner et al. used cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to analyze gene enhancer and promoter activities in a number of human and mouse cell types. The RNA of enhancers was transcribed first, followed by that of transcription factors, and finally by genes that are not transcription factors.
Science, this issue p. 1010
Although it is generally accepted that cellular differentiation requires changes to transcriptional networks, dynamic regulation of promoters and enhancers at specific sets of genes has not been previously studied en masse. Exploiting the fact that active promoters and enhancers are transcribed, we simultaneously measured their activity in 19 human and 14 mouse time courses covering a wide range of cell types and biological stimuli. Enhancer RNAs, then messenger RNAs encoding transcription factors, dominated the earliest responses. Binding sites for key lineage transcription factors were simultaneously overrepresented in enhancers and promoters active in each cellular system. Our data support a highly generalizable model in which enhancer transcription is the earliest event in successive waves of transcriptional change during cellular differentiation or activation.
The RNAs of enhancers are expressed before the genes they regulate during human and mouse cell differentiation.

Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis.

  abstract = {Background
Genome-wide quantification of enhancer activity in the human genome has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome.

Results
~In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements.

Conclusion
WHG-STARR-seq provides an improved approach to current pipelines for analysis of high complexity genomes to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation.

  abstract = {There has been much effort to prioritize genomic variants with respect to their impact on ``function''. However, function is often not precisely defined: Sometimes, it is the disease association of a variant; other times, it reflects a molecular effect on transcription or epigenetics. Here we coupled multiple genomic predictors to build GRAM, a generalized model, to predict a well-defined experimental target: the expression-modulating effect of a non-coding variant in a cell-specific manner. As a first step, we performed feature engineering: using a LASSO regularized linear model, we found transcription factor (TF) binding most predictive, especially for TFs that are hubs in the regulatory network; in contrast, evolutionary conservation, a popular feature in many other functional-impact predictors, has almost no contribution. Moreover, TF binding inferred from in vitro SELEX is as effective as that from in vivo ChIP-Seq. Second, we implemented GRAM integrating SELEX features and expression profiles. The program combines a universal regulatory score for a variant in a non-coding element with a modifier score reflecting the particular cell type. We benchmarked GRAM on a large-scale MPRA dataset in the GM12878 cell line, achieving a ROC score of \textasciitilde{}0.73; performance on the K562 cell line was similar. Finally, we evaluated the performance of GRAM on targeted regions using luciferase assays in MCF7 and K562 cell lines. We noted that changing the insertion position of the construct relative to the reporter gene gives very different results, highlighting the importance of carefully defining the functional target the model is predicting.},

  abstract = {Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease for which (1) disease-causing pathways are incompletely understood and (2) subclassification may improve patient management. Unlike other biomarkers, germline genetic markers do not change with disease progression or treatment. In this paper, we test whether a germline genetic approach informed by physiology can be used to deconstruct T2D heterogeneity. First, we aimed to categorize genetic loci into groups representing likely disease mechanistic pathways. Second, we asked whether the novel clusters of genetic loci we identified have any broad clinical consequence, as assessed in four separate subsets of individuals with T2D. Methods and findings In an effort to identify mechanistic pathways driven by established T2D genetic loci, we applied Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization (bNMF) clustering to genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for 94 independent T2D genetic variants and 47 diabetes-related traits. We identified five robust clusters of T2D loci and traits, each with distinct tissue-specific enhancer enrichment based on analysis of epigenomic data from 28 cell types. Two clusters contained variant-trait associations indicative of reduced beta cell function, differing from each other by high versus low proinsulin levels. The three other clusters displayed features of insulin resistance: obesity mediated (high body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]), ``lipodystrophy-like'' fat distribution (low BMI, adiponectin, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and high triglycerides), and disrupted liver lipid metabolism (low triglycerides). Increased cluster genetic risk scores were associated with distinct clinical outcomes, including increased blood pressure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke. We evaluated the potential for clinical impact of these clusters in four studies containing individuals with T2D (Metabolic Syndrome in Men Study [METSIM], N = 487; Ashkenazi, N = 509; Partners Biobank, N = 2,065; UK Biobank [UKBB], N = 14,813). Individuals with T2D in the top genetic risk score decile for each cluster reproducibly exhibited the predicted cluster-associated phenotypes, with approximately 30\% of all individuals assigned to just one cluster top decile. Limitations of this study include that the genetic variants used in the cluster analysis were restricted to those associated with T2D in populations of European ancestry. Conclusion Our approach identifies salient T2D genetically anchored and physiologically informed pathways, and supports the use of genetics to deconstruct T2D heterogeneity. Classification of patients by these genetic pathways may offer a step toward genetically informed T2D patient management.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and functional genomics approaches implicate enhancer disruption in islet dysfunction and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We applied genetic fine-mapping and functional (epi)genomic approaches to a T2D- and proinsulin-associated 15q22.2 locus to identify a most likely causal variant, determine its direction of effect, and elucidate plausible target genes. Fine-mapping and conditional analyses of proinsulin levels of 8,635 non-diabetic individuals from the METSIM study support a single association signal represented by a cluster of 16 strongly associated (p {$<$} 10-17) variants in high linkage disequilibrium (r2 {$>$} 0.8) with the GWAS index SNP rs7172432. These variants reside in an evolutionarily and functionally conserved islet and {$\beta$} cell stretch or super enhancer; the most strongly associated variant (rs7163757, p = 3~\texttimes{} 10-19) overlaps a conserved islet open chromatin site. DNA sequence containing the rs7163757 risk allele displayed 2-fold higher enhancer activity than the non-risk allele in reporter assays (p {$<$} 0.01) and was differentially bound by {$\beta$} cell nuclear extract proteins. Transcription factor NFAT specifically potentiated risk-allele enhancer activity and altered patterns of nuclear protein binding to the risk allele in~vitro, suggesting that it could be a factor mediating risk-allele effects. Finally, the rs7163757 proinsulin-raising and T2D risk allele (C) was associated with increased expression of C2CD4B, and possibly C2CD4A, both of which were induced by inflammatory cytokines, in human islets. Together, these data suggest that rs7163757 contributes to genetic risk of islet dysfunction and T2D by increasing NFAT-mediated islet enhancer activity and modulating C2CD4B, and possibly C2CD4A, expression in (patho)physiologic states.},

  abstract = {If trait-associated variants alter regulatory regions, then they should fall within chromatin marks in relevant cell types. However, it is unclear which of the many marks are most useful in defining cell types associated with disease and fine mapping variants. We hypothesized that informative marks are phenotypically cell type specific; that is, SNPs associated with the same trait likely overlap marks in the same cell type. We examined 15 chromatin marks and found that those highlighting active gene regulation were phenotypically cell type specific. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) was the most phenotypically cell type specific (P {$<$} 1 \texttimes{} 10(-6)), driven by colocalization of variants and marks rather than gene proximity (P {$<$} 0.001). H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with 37 SNPs for plasma low-density lipoprotein concentration in the liver (P {$<$} 7 \texttimes{} 10(-5)), 31 SNPs for rheumatoid arthritis within CD4(+) regulatory T cells (P = 1 \texttimes{} 10(-4)), 67 SNPs for type 2 diabetes in pancreatic islet cells (P = 0.003) and the liver (P = 0.003), and 14 SNPs for neuropsychiatric disease in neuronal tissues (P = 0.007). We show how cell type-specific H3K4me3 peaks can inform the fine mapping of associated SNPs to identify causal variation.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes affects over 300 million people, causing severe complications and premature death, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Pancreatic islet dysfunction is central in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, and understanding islet genome regulation could therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights. We have now mapped and examined the function of human islet cis-regulatory networks. We identify genomic sequences that are targeted by islet transcription factors to drive islet-specific gene activity and show that most such sequences reside in clusters of enhancers that form physical three-dimensional chromatin domains. We find that sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glycemia are enriched in these clustered islet enhancers and identify trait-associated variants that disrupt DNA binding and islet enhancer activity. Our studies illustrate how islet transcription factors interact functionally with the epigenome and provide systematic evidence that the dysregulation of islet enhancers is relevant to the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes.},

Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging datasets from human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

Through integrative analysis of 1,134 genome-wide epigenetic profiles, mutations from {$>$}8,200 tumor-normal pairs and our experimental data from clinical samples, we discovered broad peaks for trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3; wider than 4 kb) as the first epigenetic signature for tumor suppressors in normal cells. Broad H3K4me3 is associated with increased transcription elongation and enhancer activity, which together lead to exceptionally high gene expression, and is distinct from other broad epigenetic features, such as super-enhancers. Genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks conserved across normal cells may represent pan-cancer tumor suppressors, such as TP53 and PTEN, whereas genes with cell type\textendash{}specific broad H3K4me3 peaks may represent cell identity genes and cell type\textendash{}specific tumor suppressors. Furthermore, widespread shortening of broad H3K4me3 peaks in cancers is associated with repression of tumor suppressors. Thus, the broad H3K4me3 epigenetic signature provides mutation-independent information for the discovery and characterization of new tumor suppressors.},

Multiple validation experiments demonstrate a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Systematic analyses of EP interactions across 12 cell types reveal several global features of EP interactions: (i) a larger fraction of EP interactions are cell type specific than enhancers; (ii) promoters controlled by multiple enhancers have higher tissue specificity, but the regulating enhancers are less conserved; (iii) cohesin plays a role in mediating tissue-specific EP interactions via chromatin looping in a CTCF-independent manner.

The unprecedented scale of these data enables systematic analysis of the impact of sequence variation on transcription factor occupancy in vivo. We leverage this analysis to develop accurate models of variation affecting the recognition sites for diverse transcription factors and apply these models to discriminate nearly 500,000 common regulatory variants likely to affect transcription factor occupancy across the human genome. The approach and results provide a new foundation for the analysis and interpretation of noncoding variation in complete human genomes and for systems-level investigation of disease-associated variants.},

We identify distant gene targets for hundreds of DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrate tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs, and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms.

In higher eukaryotes, the interplay between these proteins and their interactions with the genome still is poorly understood. We systematically mapped the in vivo binding sites of seven transcription factors with diverse physiological functions, five cofactors, and two heterochromatin proteins at {$\approx$}1-kb resolution in a 2.9 Mb region of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Surprisingly, all tested transcription factors and cofactors show strongly overlapping localization patterns, and the genome contains many ``hotspots'' that are targeted by all of these proteins. Several control experiments show that the strong overlap is not an artifact of the techniques used. Colocalization hotspots are 1\textendash{}5 kb in size, spaced on average by {$\approx$}50 kb, and preferentially located in regions of active transcription. We provide evidence that protein\textendash{}protein interactions play a role in the hotspot association of some transcription factors.

However, a direct comparison of these diverse annotations is missing, and it is unclear how genetic variation within these annotations affects gene expression. Here, we compare five widely-used annotations of active regulatory elements that represent high densities of one or more relevant epigenomic marks: super and typical (non-super) enhancers, stretch enhancers, high-occupancy target (HOT) regions, and broad domains, across the four matched human cell types for which they are available. We observe that stretch and super enhancers cover cell type-specific enhancer chromatin states whereas HOT regions and broad domains comprise more ubiquitous promoter states. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in stretch enhancers have significantly smaller effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. Strikingly, chromatin accessibility QTL in stretch enhancers have significantly larger effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. These observations suggest that stretch enhancers could harbor genetically primed chromatin to enable changes in TF binding, possibly to drive cell type-specific response to environmental stimuli. Our results suggest that current eQTL studies are relatively underpowered or could lack the appropriate environmental context to detect genetic effects in the most cell type-specific regulatory annotations, which likely contributes to infrequent co-localization of eQTL with genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.},

HiC etc. techniques - limited resolution and cannot assign causality

Bayesian hierarchical approach to identify 15,000 high confidence causal interactions

"\textbf{Bayesian hierarchical modelling} is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model}{statistical model} written in multiple levels (hierarchical form) that estimates the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_model}{parameters} of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability}{posterior distribution} using"

Making sense of GWAS - use eQTL -{$>$} colocalization.

causal interactions can be deduced using mendelian randomization

Built a pairwise hierarchical model - look at all peak pairs within 500kb, hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}

\item no QTL

\item single caQTL - causal

\item linkage - two or more snps in high LD affect two peaks

\item pleiotropy - single variant independently drives association at multiple peaks

\item causality - variant affects a peak than then affects another peak

\end{enumerate}

Model:

- BF of genetic association with peaks are computed from simple linear regression. BF = p(observation | hypothesis 1 or variant associated)/p(observation | hypothesis 0 or no variant associated)

- causal relationship between two peaks is computed using 2SLS.

- hierarchical model in which prior probabilities depend on genomic annotations at multiple model levels.

- the model is empirical, such that the prior probabilities are learned as the penalized likelihood is maximized across all peak pairs simultaneously.

- \textbf{Output =} posterior probabilities of a peak pair falling into hypothesis categories, can also fetch the posterior probability of causal interaction (PPC)

~

For a matrix of ATAC seq read counts for a peak across 100 individuals -~

Construct a finite mixture of regression models to jointly observe read counts for any peak pair under the above hypotheses H = \{\vphantom\}H0, H1.1, H1.2, H2, H3, H4.1, H4.2\vphantom\{\}. 

A key feature of the hierarchical model is that the three levels of prior probabilities (variant level, peak level and peak-pair level) are allowed to depend on various genomic annotations. 

- variant level prior = P(variant i is causal | peak j is a QTL )

~~~ - depends on variant type, peak location wrt snp, peak height at snp

- peak level prior = P(peak is QTL)

~~~ - depends on peak height

- peak-pair level prior = P(categories - no interaction, pleiotropy or causality)

~~~ - depends on distance b/w peaks

~~~ - so that even peaks without qtl can be tested.. peak height

Used the expectation-maximization algorithm to iteratively estimate hyperparameters while updating the following posterior probabilities

Q how is regional bayes factor calculated?

A: ''regional'' Bayes factors, defined as the average Bayes factor across all variants in Wjk weighted by the variant prior probabilities

To calculate the marginal probability p(peak k | peak j ), regression is hard due to confounding factors. Therefore, use mendelian randomization. BF in that case = P(peak k | peak j) / P(peak k | no effect of other peak)

1. Ran model - quantified \% of causal interaction

2. Made DAGs of interactions - supplement - DAGs involve between 2 - 60 peaks

3. Simulated data - looked at false positive rate of causality when there was pleiotropy or linkage

4. Compared with 3C based assays - interactions they identify are shorter than C based approaches

5. Compared with ENCODE segmentations - N peak pairs falling ins different regions - say that Repressed regions have many peak pairs - however, this is not exactly enrichment - but still - in f, after keying on the decreasing/increasing allele, decreasing alleles overlap repressed regions more. But, if you look at c, R is not that high - so you have chromatin QTL in there

6. eQTL fine mapping - for each peak in a 1Mb window of TSS, PMR = probability of master regulator.

We defined the master regulatory peak as a peak with more than one interacting downstream peak and no interacting upstream peaks.PMR = p(peak regulates atleast one more peak in the window) * p(peak is not regulated by any other peak in the window)

~

Q: Why do 3C methods detect long range interactions and you don't detect qTL at such long distances?

a: Long range occur in relatively few cells. variants in these have low effects and can't be detected by QTL studies.~

b: short range interactions may not be driven by chromatin looping, just reflect the movement of Pol2

- Also found many interactions between enhancers, could be 'seeding' events}

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach for connecting genotype to phenotype. Most GWAS hits are located in cis-regulatory regions, but the underlying causal variants and their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To better understand human cis-regulatory variation, we mapped quantitative trait loci for chromatin accessibility (caQTLs)-a key step in cis-regulation-in 1000 individuals from 10 diverse populations. Most caQTLs were shared across populations, allowing us to leverage the genetic diversity to fine-map candidate causal regulatory variants, several thousand of which have been previously implicated in GWAS. In addition, many caQTLs that affect the expression of distal genes also alter the landscape of long-range chromosomal interactions, suggesting a mechanism for long-range expression QTLs. In sum, our results show that molecular QTL mapping integrated across diverse populations provides a high-resolution view of how worldwide human genetic variation affects chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and phenotype.

  abstract = {Summary
Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We~found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also~influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a~role for natural genetic variation in~chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.},

  abstract = {Summary
The pancreatic islets of Langerhans regulate glucose homeostasis. The loss of insulin-producing {$\beta$} cells within islets results in diabetes, and islet transplantation from cadaveric donors can cure the disease. In~vitro production of whole islets, not just {$\beta$} cells, will benefit from a better understanding of endocrine differentiation and islet morphogenesis. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing to obtain a detailed description of pancreatic islet development. Contrary to the prevailing dogma, we find islet morphology and endocrine differentiation to be directly related. As endocrine progenitors differentiate, they migrate in cohesion and form bud-like islet precursors, or ``peninsulas'' (literally ``almost islands''). {$\alpha$} cells, the first to develop, constitute the peninsular outer layer, and {$\beta{}~$}cells form later, beneath them. This spatiotemporal collinearity leads to the typical core-mantle architecture of the mature, spherical islet. Finally, we induce peninsula-like structures in differentiating human embryonic stem cells, laying the ground for the generation of entire islets in~vitro.},

We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs; promoting its oligomerization. Here we found that inhibition of transcription or interfering with CTCF ability to bind RNA through mutations of two of its 11 zinc fingers that are not involved with CTCF binding to its cognate site in vitro, zinc finger-1 (ZF1) or -10 (ZF10), disrupt CTCF association to chromatin. These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to promote local insulation. Our results highlight the importance of RNA as a structural component of the genome, in part by affecting the association of CTCF with chromatin and likely its interaction with other factors.},

We identify an enhancer set associated with functions extending to non-ESC-specific processes. Moreover, although transposable elements associate with putative enhancers, only some exhibit activity.

  issn = {1088-9051, 1549-5469},
  abstract = {Candidate enhancers can be identified on the basis of chromatin modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility. However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers requires functional characterization, typically achieved through reporter assays that test whether a sequence can increase expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter. A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address this systematically, we developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2236 candidate liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated sequences are substantially different from the activities of the identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The results of chromosomally based reporter assays are also more reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we achieve a Pearson's R2 of 0.362 for predicting the results of chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how cis-regulatory elements are identified, prioritized and functionally validated.},

The recruitment of enzymes to chromatin is regulated at multiple levels, including interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding factors. However, the DNA-binding specificity of the regulatory factors that orchestrate specific histone modifications has not been broadly mapped. We have analyzed 6 histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, K3H9me3, H3K36me3) across 121 human cell types and tissues from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project as well as 8 histone marks (with addition of H3K4me2 and H3K9ac) from the mouse ENCODE Consortium. We have identified 361 and 369 DNA motifs in human and mouse, respectively, that are the most predictive of each histone mark. Interestingly, 107 human motifs are conserved between the two species. In human embryonic cell line H1, we mutated only the found DNA motifs at particular loci and the significant reduction of H3K27ac levels validated the regulatory roles of the perturbed motifs. The functionality of these motifs was also supported by the evidence that histone-associated motifs, especially H3K4me3 motifs, significantly overlap with the expression of quantitative trait loci SNPs in cancer patients more than the known and random motifs. Furthermore, we observed possible feedbacks to control chromatin dynamics as the found motifs appear in the promoters or enhancers associated with various histone modification enzymes. These results pave the way toward revealing the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic events, such as histone modification dynamics and epigenetic priming.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Motivated by the dynamics of development, in which cells of recognizable types, or pure cell types, transition into other types over time, we propose a method of semi-soft clustering that can classify both pure and intermediate cell types from data on gene expression from individual cells. Called SOUP, for Semi-sOft clUstering with Pure cells, this novel algorithm reveals the clustering structure for both pure cells and transitional cells with soft memberships. SOUP involves a two-step process: identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure in the expression similarity matrix. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. By modeling cells as a continuous mixture of K discrete types we obtain more parsimonious results than obtained with standard clustering algorithms. Moreover, using soft membership estimates of cell type cluster centers leads to better estimates of developmental trajectories. The strong performance of SOUP is documented via simulation studies, which show its robustness to violations of modeling assumptions. The advantages of SOUP are illustrated by analyses of two independent data sets of gene expression from a large number of cells from fetal brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we present Perturb-ATAC, a method that combines multiplexed CRISPR interference or knockout with genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling in single cells based on the simultaneous detection of CRISPR guide RNAs and open chromatin sites by assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). We applied Perturb-ATAC to transcription factors (TFs), chromatin-modifying factors, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in {$\sim$}4,300 single cells, encompassing more than 63 genotype-phenotype relationships. Perturb-ATAC in human B~lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate. Combinatorial deletion of all pairs of these TFs~uncovered their epistatic relationships and highlighted genomic co-localization as a basis for synergistic interactions. Thus, Perturb-ATAC is a powerful strategy to dissect gene regulatory networks in development and disease.},

  abstract = {We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in 27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease.},

Comparison of FAIRE-seq data from islets to that from five non-islet cell lines revealed {$\sim$}3,300 physically linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which typically encompassed single genes that have islet-specific expression. We mapped sequence variants to open chromatin sites and found that rs7903146, a TCF7L2 intronic variant strongly associated with type 2 diabetes5, is located in islet-selective open chromatin. We found that human islet samples heterozygous for rs7903146 showed allelic imbalance in islet FAIRE signals and that the variant alters enhancer activity, indicating that genetic variation at this locus acts in cis with local chromatin and regulatory changes. These findings illuminate the tissue-specific organization of cis-regulatory elements and show that FAIRE-seq can guide the identification of regulatory variants underlying disease susceptibility.},

We examined the effects of these rare in European variants on plasma lipid levels in 828 Hutterites and applied a Bayesian hierarchical framework to prioritize potentially causal variants based on functional annotations. We identified two novel non-coding rare variants associated with LDL cholesterol (rs17242388 in LDLR) and HDL cholesterol (rs189679427 between GOT2 and APOOP5), and replicated previous associations of a splice variant in APOC3 (rs138326449) with triglycerides and HDL-C. All three variants are at well-replicated loci in GWAS but are independent from and have larger effect sizes than the known common variation in these regions. Candidate eQTL analyses in in LCLs in the Hutterites suggest that these rare non-coding variants are likely to mediate their effects on lipid traits by regulating gene expression.},

We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability.

  abstract = {Genetic variants regulating RNA splicing and transcript usage have been implicated in both common and rare diseases. Although transcript usage quantitative trait loci (tuQTLs) have been mapped across multiple cell types and contexts, it is challenging to distinguish between the main molecular mechanisms controlling transcript usage: promoter choice, splicing and 3' end choice. Here, we analysed RNA-seq data from human macrophages exposed to three inflammatory and one metabolic stimulus. In addition to conventional gene-level and transcript-level analyses, we also directly quantified promoter usage, splicing and 3' end usage. We found that promoters, splicing and 3' ends were predominantly controlled by independent genetic variants enriched in distinct genomic features. Promoter usage QTLs were also 50\% more likely to be context-specific than other tuQTLs and constituted 25\% of the transcript-level colocalisations with complex traits. Thus, promoter usage might be an underappreciated molecular mechanism mediating complex trait associations in a context-specific manner., Genes contain all instructions needed to build an organism in form of DNA. Humans share around 99.5\% of DNA, but it is the remaining 0.5\% that contain the small genetic variations that make us unique. Subtle differences in genes can, for example, influence the color of our hair or eyes., To build gene products, such as proteins, DNA first needs to be transcribed into RNA. Some genetic variants can affect how a gene is transcribed into an RNA molecule, for example by making it be transcribed too much or too little, which can lead to diseases. These variants can also influence where the transcription begins through a process called promoter usage. This can lead to shorter or longer RNAs, which can have different biological impacts., With current research methods it is difficult to detect changes in the latter kind of alteration. As a result, it is harder to distinguish these from other types of changes. Now, Alasoo et al. wanted to find out what proportion of genetic variants that alter traits influence promoter usage, compared to other changes. To do so, a new computational method was developed to directly measure how genetic variants influence different parts of the RNA, such as promoters, middle sections and ends. The method was then applied to datasets of human immune cells. The experiments revealed that genetic variants often influence promoter usage. Many of the effects could only be found when cells are exposed to external stimuli, such as bacteria., The results highlight that to discover genes responsible for human traits and disease we need to consider all the possible ways genetic differences between individuals could alter the gene products. Large published datasets could be reanalyzed using this method to identify new genes that could be implicated in human health and disease, potentially leading to new treatment options in future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) is extensively regulated by seven writer- and six eraser enzymes in mammalian cells. Nine of the 13 H3K4me enzymes have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders to date, indicating their important yet poorly-understood roles in the brain. Opposite activities of writer-eraser enzymes highlight modulation of their activities as a therapeutic strategy. However, interplay among the H3K4me enzymes in the brain remains largely unknown. Here, we show functional interactions of a writer-eraser duo, KMT2A and KDM5C, which are responsible for Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WDSTS), and mental retardation X-linked syndromic Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ), respectively. Despite the opposing enzymatic activities, the WDSTS and MRXSCJ mouse models, deficient for either Kmt2a or Kdm5c, shared similar brain transcriptomes, reduced dendritic spines, and increased aggression. The altered H3K4me landscapes and transcriptomes in the single mutants were partially corrected in the Kmt2a-Kdm5c double-mutant (DM) mice. Moreover, the reduced spine density and key behavioral traits including aggression were clearly reversed in DM mice. Thus, our study uncovers common yet mutually-suppressive aspects of WDSTS and MRXCJ and provides a proof of principle for balancing a single writer-eraser pair to ameliorate their associated disorders.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Some animals, including some types of worms, can undergo whole-body regeneration and replace virtually any missing cell type. Gehrke et al. sequenced and assembled the genome of Hofstenia miamia, a regenerative acoel worm species (see the Perspective by Alonge and Schatz). They identified a variable motif corresponding to regulation of the early growth response (egr) gene that was involved in regeneration. RNA interference experiments and validation in a second species showed that the protein Egr is a pioneer factor that stimulates regeneration.
Science, this issue p. eaau6173; see also p. 1152
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONAlthough all animals can heal wounds, some are capable of reconstructing their entire bodies from small fragments of the original organism. Whole-body regeneration requires the interplay of wound signaling, stem cell dynamics, and positional identity, all of which have been investigated at the protein-coding level of the genome. Little is known about how the noncoding portion of the genome responds to wounding to control gene expression and to launch the process of whole-body regeneration. Understanding how these control points (regulatory regions) are activated and then operate during regeneration would uncover how genes connect into networks, ultimately restructuring entire body axes. Networks of transcriptional regulatory genes can reveal important mechanisms for how animals can grow new skin, muscles, or even entire brains.
RATIONALETo identify regulatory regions involved in whole-body regeneration, we sequenced the genome of the highly regenerative acoel Hofstenia miamia, commonly known as the three-banded panther worm. Equipped with this genome, we reasoned that applying the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) would identify regulatory regions that change in response to amputation and during whole-body regeneration. Further, by analyzing the sequence motifs contained within these regulatory regions, we sought to predict which transcription factors (TFs) control regeneration gene networks.
RESULTSThe Hofstenia genome assembly totals 950 megabases of sequence, with sufficient contiguity for functional genomics. ATAC-seq data revealed thousands of chromatin regions that respond dynamically during regeneration. A genome-wide scan for TF binding motifs in these regions identified the EGR (early growth response) motif as the most dynamic. By combining RNA interference (RNAi) and RNA-seq, we predicted a set of Egr target genes in Hofstenia. We found that most of these target genes contained EGR binding motifs in neighboring regions of regeneration-responsive chromatin, which failed to respond under egr-RNAi. This functional validation allowed us to build a gene regulatory network (GRN) with Egr as a direct master regulator of downstream regeneration genes. Lastly, by quantifying the binding probabilities of TFs at individual motifs, we identified targets of TFs further downstream of Egr, extending the regeneration GRN.
CONCLUSIONUsing our regulatory data, we inferred a GRN for launching whole-body regeneration in the acoel H. miamia, where the master regulator Egr acts as a putative pioneer factor to directly activate wound-induced genes. This network includes homologs of genes that are involved in regeneration in other species, suggesting that it can serve as a template for direct comparisons of regeneration pathways across distantly related animals. Our approach of combining genome-wide assays for chromatin accessibility with functional studies can be applied to extend the network further in time in Hofstenia regeneration and to construct GRNs for regeneration in other systems. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6432/eaau6173/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The regulatory landscape of whole-body regeneration.Hofstenia represents the sister-lineage of other bilaterians and regenerates extensively. We sequenced the genome of H. miamia and used ATAC-seq to identify thousands of regeneration-responsive regions of chromatin. Combining motif analysis, ATAC-seq, and RNAi, we identified Egr as a master regulator of regeneration in Hofstenia and inferred an Egr-controlled GRN for regeneration.
Whole-body regeneration is accompanied by complex transcriptomic changes, yet the chromatin regulatory landscapes that mediate this dynamic response remain unexplored. To decipher the regulatory logic that orchestrates regeneration, we sequenced the genome of the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia, a highly regenerative member of the sister lineage of other bilaterians. Epigenomic profiling revealed thousands of regeneration-responsive chromatin regions and identified dynamically bound transcription factor motifs, with the early growth response (EGR) binding site as the most variably accessible during Hofstenia regeneration. Combining egr inhibition with chromatin profiling suggests that Egr functions as a pioneer factor to directly regulate early wound-induced genes. The genetic connections inferred by this approach allowed the construction of a gene regulatory network for whole-body regeneration, enabling genomics-based comparisons of regeneration across species.
The genome of the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia elucidates a gene regulatory network that underlies the ability to regenerate.

The risk alleles impair glucose-induced insulin secretion and, paradoxically but characteristically, are associated with decreased proinsulin:insulin ratios, indicating improved proinsulin conversion. Neither the identity of the causal variants nor the gene(s) through which risk is conferred have been firmly established. Whereas ARAP1 encodes a GTPase activating protein, STARD10 is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer protein family. By integrating genetic fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation data and performing promoter-reporter and chromatin conformational capture (3C) studies in {$\beta$} cell lines, we localize the causal variant(s) at this locus to a 5 kb region that overlaps a stretch-enhancer active in islets. This region contains several highly correlated T2D-risk variants, including the rs140130268 indel. Expression QTL analysis of islet transcriptomes from three independent subject groups demonstrated that T2D-risk allele carriers displayed reduced levels of STARD10 mRNA, with no concomitant change in ARAP1 mRNA levels. Correspondingly, {$\beta$}-cell-selective deletion of StarD10 in mice led to impaired glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and insulin secretion and recapitulated the pattern of improved proinsulin processing observed at the human GWAS signal. Conversely, overexpression of StarD10 in the adult {$\beta$} cell improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed animals. In contrast, manipulation of Arap1 in {$\beta$} cells had no impact on insulin secretion or proinsulin conversion in mice. This convergence of human and murine data provides compelling evidence that the T2D risk associated with variation at this locus is mediated through reduction in STARD10 expression in the {$\beta$} cell.},

  abstract = {A major use of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) data is genotype imputation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we develop a method to estimate haplotypes from low-coverage sequencing data that can take advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotypes on the same samples. First the SNP array data are phased to build a backbone (or `scaffold') of haplotypes across each chromosome. We then phase the sequence data `onto' this haplotype scaffold. This approach can take advantage of relatedness between sequenced and non-sequenced samples to improve accuracy. We use this method to create a new 1000GP haplotype reference set for use by the human genetic community. Using a set of validation genotypes at SNP and bi-allelic indels we show that these haplotypes have lower genotype discordance and improved imputation performance into downstream GWAS samples, especially at low-frequency variants.},

  abstract = {Many of the type 2 diabetes loci identified through genome-wide association studies localize to non-protein-coding intronic and intergenic regions and likely contain variants that regulate gene transcription. The CDC123/CAMK1D type 2 diabetes association signal on chromosome 10 spans an intergenic region between CDC123 and CAMK1D and also overlaps the CDC123 3{${'}$}UTR. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the association signal, we used open chromatin, histone modifications and transcription factor ChIP-seq data sets from type 2 diabetes-relevant cell types to identify SNPs overlapping predicted regulatory regions. Two regions containing type 2 diabetes-associated variants were tested for enhancer activity using luciferase reporter assays. One SNP, rs11257655, displayed allelic differences in transcriptional enhancer activity in 832/13 and MIN6 insulinoma cells as well as in human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The rs11257655 risk allele T showed greater transcriptional activity than the non-risk allele C in all cell types tested. Using electromobility shift and supershift assays we demonstrated that the rs11257655 risk allele showed allele-specific binding to FOXA1 and FOXA2. We validated FOXA1 and FOXA2 enrichment at the rs11257655 risk allele using allele-specific ChIP in human islets. These results suggest that rs11257655 affects transcriptional activity through altered binding of a protein complex that includes FOXA1 and FOXA2, providing a potential molecular mechanism at this GWAS locus.},

Comparison to empirical ChIP-seq data suggests that our method is highly accurate yet has the advantage of targeting many factors in a single assay.

The K2P channel TWIK-related alkaline pH-activated K2P (TALK)-1 is linked to type 2 diabetes risk through a coding sequence polymorphism (rs1535500); however, its physiological function has remained elusive. Here, we show that TALK-1 channels are expressed in mouse and human {$\beta$}-cells, where they serve as key regulators of electrical excitability and GSIS. We find that the rs1535500 polymorphism, which results in an alanine-to-glutamate substitution in the C-terminus of human TALK-1, increases channel activity. Genetic ablation of TALK-1 results in {$\beta$}-cell membrane potential depolarization, increased islet Ca2+ influx, and enhanced second-phase GSIS. Moreover, mice lacking TALK-1 channels are resistant to high-fat diet\textendash{}induced elevations in fasting glycemia. These findings reveal TALK-1 channels as important modulators of second-phase insulin secretion and suggest a clinically relevant mechanism for rs1535500, which may increase type 2 diabetes risk by limiting GSIS.},

These core TFs collectively regulate their own gene expression, thus forming an interconnected auto-regulatory loop that can be considered the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry (CRC) for that cell type. There is limited knowledge of core TFs, and thus models of core regulatory circuitry, for most cell types. We recently discovered that genes encoding known core TFs forming CRCs are driven by super-enhancers, which provides an opportunity to systematically predict CRCs in poorly studied cell types through super-enhancer mapping. Here, we use super-enhancer maps to generate CRC models for 75 human cell and tissue types. These core circuitry models should prove valuable for further investigating cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation in healthy and diseased cells.},

  abstract = {Chromatin structure plays an important role in modulating the accessibility of genomic DNA to regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. We performed an integrative analysis on dozens of recent datasets generated by deep-sequencing and high-density tiling arrays, and we discovered an array of well-positioned nucleosomes flanking sites occupied by the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome. These nucleosomes are highly enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z and 11 histone modifications. The distances between the center positions of the neighboring nucleosomes are largely invariant, and we estimate them to be 185 bp on average. Surprisingly, subsets of nucleosomes that are enriched in different histone modifications vary greatly in the lengths of DNA protected from micrococcal nuclease cleavage (106\textendash{}164 bp). The nucleosomes enriched in those histone modifications previously implicated to be correlated with active transcription tend to contain less protected DNA, indicating that these modifications are correlated with greater DNA accessibility. Another striking result obtained from our analysis is that nucleosomes flanking CTCF sites are much better positioned than those downstream of transcription start sites, the only genomic feature previously known to position nucleosomes genome-wide. This nucleosome-positioning phenomenon is not observed for other transcriptional factors for which we had genome-wide binding data. We suggest that binding of CTCF provides an anchor point for positioning nucleosomes, and chromatin remodeling is an important component of CTCF function.},

  abstract = {Compared to enhancers, silencers are notably difficult to identify and validate experimentally. In search for human silencers, we utilized H3K27me3-DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) peaks with tissue-specificity negatively correlated with the expression of nearby genes across 25 diverse cell lines. These regions are predicted to be silencers since they are physically linked, using Hi-C loops, or associated, using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) results, with a decrease in gene expression much more frequently than general H3K27me3-DHSs. Also, these regions are enriched for the binding sites of transcriptional repressors (such as CTCF, MECOM, SMAD4, and SNAI3) and depleted of the binding sites of transcriptional activators. Using sequence signatures of these regions, we constructed a computational model and predicted approximately ten thousand additional silencers per cell line and demonstrated that the majority of genes linked to these silencers are expressed at a decreased level. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in predicted silencers are significantly associated with disease phenotypes. Finally, our results show that silencers commonly interact with enhancers to affect the transcriptional dynamics of tissue-specific genes and to facilitate fine-tuning of transcription in the human genome.},

The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci.

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%-20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

Here, we examine the differences and similarities between the architecture of human and mouse islets. We studied islets from various mouse models including ob/ob and db/db and pregnant mice. We also examined the islets of monkeys, pigs, rabbits and birds for further comparisons. Despite differences in overall body and pancreas size as well as total beta-cell mass among these species, the distribution of their islet sizes closely overlaps, except in the bird pancreas in which the delta-cell population predominates (both in singlets and clusters) along with a small number of islets. Markedly large islets ({$>$}10,000 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m2) were observed in human and monkey islets as well as in islets from ob/ob and pregnant mice. The fraction of {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, and {$\delta$}-cells within an islet varied between islets in all the species examined. Furthermore, there was variability in the distribution of alpha- and delta-cells with the same species. In summary, human and mouse islets share common architectural features that may reflect demand for insulin. Comparative studies of islet architecture may lead to a better understanding of islet development and function.},

  abstract = {Development of type 1 diabetes in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is preceded by an immune cell infiltrate in the pancreatic islets. The exact role of the attracted cells is still poorly understood. Chemokine CCL2/MCP-1 is known to attract CCR2(+) monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). We have previously shown that transgenic expression of CCL2 in pancreatic islets via the rat insulin promoter induces nondestructive insulitis on a nonautoimmune background. We report here an unexpected reduction of diabetes development on the NOD background despite an increased islet cell infiltrate with markedly increased numbers of CD11c(+) CD11b(+) DCs. These DCs exhibited a hypoactive phenotype with low CD40, MHC II, CD80/CD86 expression, and reduced TNF-{$\alpha$} but elevated IL-10 secretions. They failed to induce proliferation of diabetogenic CD4(+) T cells in vitro. Pancreatic lymph node CD4(+) T cells were down-regulated ex vivo and expressed the anergy marker Grail. By using an in vivo transfer system, we show that CD11c(+) CD11b(+) DCs from rat insulin promoter-CCL2 transgenic NOD mice were the most potent cells suppressing diabetes development. These findings support an unexpected beneficial role for CCL2 in type 1 diabetes with implications for current strategies interfering with the CCL2/CCR2 axis in humans, and for dendritic cell biology in autoimmunity.},

We addressed the identified limitations to develop a robust workflow that supports both rapid and high-throughput projects also reducing reagent costs.
RESULTS: We show that an initial bead-based normalisation step can remove the need for quantification and improves sample purity. A 75\% cost reduction was achieved with a low-volume modified protocol which was tested over genomes with different GC content to demonstrate its robustness. Finally we developed a custom set of index tags and primers which increase the number of samples that can simultaneously be sequenced on a single lane of an Illumina instrument.
CONCLUSIONS: We addressed the bottlenecks of Nextera library construction to produce a modified protocol which harnesses the full power of the Nextera kit and allows the reproducible construction of libraries on a high-throughput scale reducing the associated cost of the kit.},

We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human 'knockout' variants in protein-coding genes.},

Using these 53 loci, we show a polygenic contribution to familial partial lipodystrophy type 1, a severe form of insulin resistance, and highlight shared molecular mechanisms in common/mild and rare/severe insulin resistance. Population-level genetic analyses combined with experiments in cellular models implicate CCDC92, DNAH10 and L3MBTL3 as previously unrecognized molecules influencing adipocyte differentiation.

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: There are potential advantages to the low-temperature (-196 \textdegree{}C) banking of isolated islets, including the maintenance of viable islets for future research. We therefore assessed the in vitro and in vivo function of islets cryopreserved for nearly 20 years.
METHODS: Human islets were cryopreserved from 1991 to 2001 and thawed between 2012 and 2014. These were characterised by immunostaining, patch-clamp electrophysiology, insulin secretion, transcriptome analysis and transplantation into a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of diabetes.
RESULTS: The cryopreservation time was 17.6 {$\pm$} 0.4 years (n = 43). The thawed islets stained positive with dithizone, contained insulin-positive and glucagon-positive cells, and displayed levels of apoptosis and transcriptome profiles similar to those of freshly isolated islets, although their insulin content was lower. The cryopreserved beta cells possessed ion channels and exocytotic responses identical to those of freshly isolated beta cells. Cells from a subset of five donors demonstrated similar perifusion insulin secretion profiles pre- and post-cryopreservation. The transplantation of cryopreserved islets into the diabetic mice improved their glucose tolerance but did not completely normalise their blood glucose levels. Circulating human insulin and insulin-positive grafts were detectable at 10 weeks post-transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated the potential for long-term banking of human islets for research, which could enable the use of tissue from a large number of donors with future technologies to gain new insight into diabetes.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Many studies have previously identified genetic variants for gene expression phenotypes using custom and commercially available microarrays1,2,3,4,5. Second generation sequencing technologies are now providing unprecedented access to the fine structure of the transcriptome6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. We have sequenced the mRNA fraction of the transcriptome in 60 extended HapMap individuals of European descent and have combined these data with genetic variants from the HapMap3 project15. We have quantified exon abundance based on read depth and have also developed methods to quantify whole transcript abundance. We have found that approximately 10 million reads of sequencing can provide access to the same dynamic range as arrays with better quantification of alternative and highly abundant transcripts. Correlation with SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery of eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) than with arrays. We also detect a substantial number of variants that influence the structure of mature transcripts indicating variants responsible for alternative splicing. Finally, measures of allele-specific expression allowed the identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences in transcript structure. This analysis shows that high throughput sequencing technologies reveal new properties of genetic effects on the transcriptome and allow the exploration of genetic effects in cellular processes.},

Pancreatic beta cells within the islets of Langerhans are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Describing the differentiated state of the human beta cell has been hampered so far by technical (low resolution microarrays) and biological limitations (whole islet preparations rather than isolated beta cells). We circumvent these by deep RNA sequencing of purified beta cells from 11 individuals, presenting here the first characterization of the human beta cell transcriptome. We perform the first comparison of gene expression profiles between beta cells, whole islets, and beta cell depleted islet preparations, revealing thus beta-cell-specific expression and splicing signatures. Further, we demonstrate that genes with consistent increased expression in beta cells have neuronal-like properties, a signal previously hypothesized. Finally, we find evidence for extensive allelic imbalance in expression and uncover genetic regulatory variants (eQTLs) active in beta cells. This first molecular blueprint of the human beta cell offers biological insight into its differentiated function, including expression of key genes associated with both major types of diabetes.},

A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34+ stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal.},

  abstract = {Aims/hypothesisThe aim of the study was to determine whether purified beta cells can replicate in vitro and whether this is enhanced by extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factors.MethodsHuman beta cells were purified by FACS by virtue of their high zinc content using Newport Green, and excluding ductal and dead cells. Rat beta cells were sorted by autofluorescence or using the same method developed for human cells. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine or ECMs from rat or human bladder carcinoma cells or bovine corneal ECM and incubated in the presence of BrdU with or without growth factors.ResultsThe newly developed method for sorting human beta cells yields a population containing 91.4 {$\pm$} 2.8\% insulin-positive cells with a low level of spontaneous apoptosis and a robust secretory response to glucose. Beta cells from 8-week-old rats proliferated in culture and this was increased by ECM. Among growth factors, only human growth hormone (hGH) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide enhanced proliferation of rat beta cells, with a significant increase on both poly-l-lysine and ECM. By contrast, sorted adult human beta cells from 16 donors aged 48.9 {$\pm$} 14.3 years (range 16\textendash{}64 years) failed to replicate demonstrably in vitro regardless of the substratum or growth factors used.Conclusions/interpretationThese findings indicate that, in our conditions, the fully differentiated human adult insulin-producing beta cell was unable to proliferate in vitro. This has important implications for any attempt to expand cells from pancreases of donors of this age group. By contrast, the rat beta cells used here were able to divide in vitro, and this was enhanced by ECM, hGH and liraglutide.},

Loci influencing fasting insulin concentration showed association with lipid levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on insulin resistance. Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations. This conclusion is supported by an excess of directionally consistent and nominally significant signals between discovery and follow-up studies. Functional analysis of these newly discovered loci will further improve our understanding of glycemic control.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pancreatic islet beta cell failure causes type 2 diabetes in humans. To identify transcriptomic changes in type 2 diabetic islets, the Innovative Medicines Initiative for Diabetes: Improving beta-cell function and identification of diagnostic biomarkers for treatment monitoring in Diabetes (IMIDIA) consortium ( www.imidia.org ) established a comprehensive, unique multicentre biobank of human islets and pancreas tissues from organ donors and metabolically phenotyped pancreatectomised patients (PPP).
METHODS: Affymetrix microarrays were used to assess the islet transcriptome of islets isolated either by enzymatic digestion from 103 organ donors (OD), including 84 non-diabetic and 19 type 2 diabetic individuals, or by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from surgical specimens of 103 PPP, including 32 non-diabetic, 36 with type 2 diabetes, 15 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 20 with recent-onset diabetes ({$<$}1 year), conceivably secondary to the pancreatic disorder leading to surgery (type 3c diabetes). Bioinformatics tools were used to (1) compare the islet transcriptome of type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic OD and PPP as well as vs IGT and type 3c diabetes within the PPP group; and (2) identify transcription factors driving gene co-expression modules correlated with insulin secretion ex vivo and glucose tolerance in vivo. Selected genes of interest were validated for their expression and function in beta cells.
RESULTS: Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified 19 genes differentially expressed (false discovery rate {$\leq$}0.05, fold change {$\geq$}1.5) in type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic islets from OD and PPP. Nine out of these 19 dysregulated genes were not previously reported to be dysregulated in type 2 diabetic islets. Signature genes included TMEM37, which inhibited Ca2+-influx and insulin secretion in beta cells, and ARG2 and PPP1R1A, which promoted insulin secretion. Systems biology approaches identified HNF1A, PDX1 and REST as drivers of gene co-expression modules correlated with impaired insulin secretion or glucose tolerance, and 14 out of 19 differentially expressed type 2 diabetic islet signature genes were enriched in these modules. None of these signature genes was significantly dysregulated in islets of PPP with impaired glucose tolerance or type 3c diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These studies enabled the stringent definition of a novel transcriptomic signature of type 2 diabetic islets, regardless of islet source and isolation procedure. Lack of this signature in islets from PPP with IGT or type 3c diabetes indicates differences possibly due to peculiarities of these hyperglycaemic conditions and/or a role for duration and severity of hyperglycaemia. Alternatively, these transcriptomic changes capture, but may not precede, beta cell failure.},

  abstract = {Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach\textemdash{}we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini\textendash{}Hochberg FDR method.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Proinsulin is a precursor of mature insulin and C-peptide. Higher circulating proinsulin levels are associated with impaired {$\beta$}-cell function, raised glucose levels, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Studies of the insulin processing pathway could provide new insights about T2D pathophysiology.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We have conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association tests of {$\sim$}2.5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting proinsulin levels in 10,701 nondiabetic adults of European ancestry, with follow-up of 23 loci in up to 16,378 individuals, using additive genetic models adjusted for age, sex, fasting insulin, and study-specific covariates.
RESULTS Nine SNPs at eight loci were associated with proinsulin levels (P {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-8). Two loci (LARP6 and SGSM2) have not been previously related to metabolic traits, one (MADD) has been associated with fasting glucose, one (PCSK1) has been implicated in obesity, and four (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, VPS13C/C2CD4A/B, and ARAP1, formerly CENTD2) increase T2D risk. The proinsulin-raising allele of ARAP1 was associated with a lower fasting glucose (P = 1.7 \texttimes{} 10-4), improved {$\beta$}-cell function (P = 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-5), and lower risk of T2D (odds ratio 0.88; P = 7.8 \texttimes{} 10-6). Notably, PCSK1 encodes the protein prohormone convertase 1/3, the first enzyme in the insulin processing pathway. A genotype score composed of the nine proinsulin-raising alleles was not associated with coronary disease in two large case-control datasets.
CONCLUSIONS We have identified nine genetic variants associated with fasting proinsulin. Our findings illuminate the biology underlying glucose homeostasis and T2D development in humans and argue against a direct role of proinsulin in coronary artery disease pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: For heterogeneous tissues, measurements of gene expression through mRNA-Seq data are confounded by relative proportions of cell types involved. In this note, we introduce an efficient pipeline: DeconRNASeq, an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on mRNA-Seq data. It adopts a globally optimized non-negative decomposition algorithm through quadratic programming for estimating the mixing proportions of distinctive tissue types in next-generation sequencing data. We demonstrated the feasibility and validity of DeconRNASeq across a range of mixing levels and sources using mRNA-Seq data mixed in silico at known concentrations. We validated our computational approach for various benchmark data, with high correlation between our predicted cell proportions and the real fractions of tissues. Our study provides a rigorous, quantitative and high-resolution tool as a prerequisite to use mRNA-Seq data. The modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines for data from other high-throughput platforms.

  abstract = {RNA sequencing is an increasingly popular technology for genome-wide analysis of transcript sequence and abundance. However, understanding of the sources of technical and interlaboratory variation is still limited. To address this, the GEUVADIS consortium sequenced mRNAs and small RNAs of lymphoblastoid cell lines of 465 individuals in seven sequencing centers, with a large number of replicates. The variation between laboratories appeared to be considerably smaller than the already limited biological variation. Laboratory effects were mainly seen in differences in insert size and GC content and could be adequately corrected for. In small-RNA sequencing, the microRNA (miRNA) content differed widely between samples owing to competitive sequencing of rRNA fragments. This did not affect relative quantification of miRNAs. We conclude that distributing RNA sequencing among different laboratories is feasible, given proper standardization and randomization procedures. We provide a set of quality measures and guidelines for assessing technical biases in RNA-seq data.},

  abstract = {Close to 50 genetic loci have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but they explain only 15\% of the heritability.

Using 48 genes located near T2D risk variants, we identified gene coexpression and protein-protein interaction networks that were strongly associated with islet insulin secretion and HbA(1c). We integrated our data to form a rank list of putative T2D genes, of which CHL1, LRFN2, RASGRP1, and PPM1K were validated in INS-1 cells to influence insulin secretion, whereas GPR120 affected apoptosis in islets. Expression variation of the top 20 genes explained 24\% of the variance in HbA(1c) with no claim of the direction.

Here, we demonstrate that the number of bases in enhancers linked to a gene reflects its disease pathogenicity. Moreover, genes with redundant enhancer domains are depleted of cis-acting genetic variants that disrupt gene expression, and are buffered against the effects of disruptive non-coding mutations. Our results demonstrate that dosage-sensitive genes have evolved robustness to the disruptive effects of genetic variation by expanding their regulatory domains. This resolves a puzzle in the genetic literature about why disease genes are depleted of cis-eQTLs, suggesting that eQTL information may implicate the wrong genes at genome-wide association study loci, and establishes a framework for identifying non-coding regulatory variation with phenotypic consequences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding the physiological mechanisms by which common variants predispose to type 2 diabetes requires large studies with detailed measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity. Here we performed the largest genome-wide association study of first-phase insulin secretion, as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes from 10 studies. We aimed to refine the mechanisms of 178 known associations between common variants and glycemic traits and identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of first-phase insulin secretion at P {$<$} 0.05 and provided new evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion, intrinsic to the islet cells, is a key mechanism underlying the associations at the HNF1A, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, VPS13C/C2CD4A, FAF1, PTPRD, AP3S2, KCNK16, MAEA, LPP, WFS1, and TMPRSS6 loci. The fasting glucose-raising allele near PDX1, a known key insulin transcription factor, was strongly associated with lower first-phase insulin secretion but has no evidence for an effect on type 2 diabetes risk. The diabetes risk allele at TCF7L2 was associated with a stronger effect on peak insulin response than on C-peptide-based insulin secretion rate, suggesting a possible additional role in hepatic insulin clearance or insulin processing. In summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which common genetic variation influences type 2 diabetes risk and glycemic traits.},

  abstract = {Two cell lines have been established from insulinomas obtained by targeted expression of the simian virus 40 T antigen gene in transgenic mice. These cell lines, designated MIN6 and MIN7, produce insulin and T antigen and have morphological characteristics of pancreatic beta cells. MIN6 cells exhibit glucose-inducible insulin secretion comparable with cultured normal mouse islet cells, whereas MIN7 cells do not. Both cell lines produce liver-type glucose transporter (GT) mRNA at high level. Brain-type GT mRNA is also present at considerable level in MIN7 cells, but is barely detectable in MIN6 cells, suggesting that exclusive expression of the liver-type GT is related to glucose-inducible insulin secretion. MIN6 cells do not express either major histocompatibility (MHC) class I or class II antigens on the cell surface. However, treatment with interferon-gamma induces high levels of MHC class I antigens, and a combination of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induces a MHC class II antigen on the cell surface. These results emphasize that the MIN6 cell line retains physiological characteristics of normal beta cells. The MIN6 cell line will be especially useful to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which beta cells regulate insulin secretion in response to extracellular glucose concentrations. We discuss a possible role of GT isoforms in glucose sensing by beta cells.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {1553-7358},
  abstract = {Genetic variants underlying complex traits, including disease susceptibility, are enriched within the transcriptional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers. There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases share similar patterns of transcriptional activity. Accordingly, shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify underlying biological processes. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied, phenotype-associated variants in regulatory regions were linked to tightly-coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional characteristics. Coexpression provides a new signal, independent of phenotype association, to enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific traits, including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly implicates particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For example, distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions implicate two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis; a further two separate processes are implicated in Crohn's disease. Thus, our functional analysis of genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct disease endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond differently to pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings enable a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors, can be estimated from pedigree data, but such estimates are uninformative with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on unrelated individuals have shown that for human traits and disease, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs. It is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular if the causal variants are rare, or other reasons such as over-estimation of heritability from pedigree data. Here we show that pedigree heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) appears to be fully recovered from whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on 21,620 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We assigned 47.1 million genetic variants to groups based upon their minor allele frequencies (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants nearby, and estimated and partitioned variation accordingly. The estimated heritability was 0.79 (SE 0.09) for height and 0.40 (SE 0.09) for BMI, consistent with pedigree estimates. Low-MAF variants in low LD with neighbouring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein altering variants, consistent with negative selection thereon. Cumulatively variants in the MAF range of 0.0001 to 0.1 explained 0.54 (SE 0.05) and 0.51 (SE 0.11) of heritability for height and BMI, respectively.

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease in which the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, microvascular events, and mortality are all strongly associated with hyperglycemia (1). The disease course is primarily characterized by a decline in {$\beta$}-cell function and worsening of insulin resistance. The process is manifested clinically by deteriorations in multiple parameters, including A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose levels.

In this review, we will evaluate our current understanding of the role played by deteriorating {$\beta$}-cell function and other abnormalities linked with the progression of type 2 diabetes. An improved understanding of these abnormalities may provide the scientific groundwork for novel therapies that may help achieve and maintain good glycemic control.

\#\#\# Progression from pre-diabetes to overt diabetes

Because glucose is a continuous variable, the use of thresholds to make a diagnosis is somewhat arbitrary. The term ``pre-diabetes'' has become well established and implies a risk of progression to overt diabetes. However, although such progression is well studied in prevention trials, little is known about the rate of progression and the characteristics of such progression in the population at large. Table 1 summarizes some of the factors associated with such progression. Nichols et al. (2) studied the progression of pre-diabetes to overt disease and observed that 8.1\% of subjects whose initial abnormal fasting glucose was 100\textendash{}109 mg/dl and 24.3\% of subjects whose initial abnormal fasting glucose was 110\textendash{}125 mg/dl developed diabetes over an average of 29.0 months (1.34 and 5.56\% per year, respectively). A steeper rate of increasing fasting glucose; higher BMI, blood pressure, and triglycerides; and lower HDL cholesterol predicted diabetes development.

Today, more than 120 variants have been convincingly replicated for association with T2D and many more with diabetes-related traits.

In this review, we address the possibilities to elucidate the genetic landscape of T2D as well as discuss pitfalls with current strategies to identify the elusive unknown heritability including the possibility that our definition of diabetes and its subgroups is imprecise and thereby makes the identification of genetic causes difficult.},

  abstract = {Aims/hypothesisTo study the heritability and familiality of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits in families from the Botnia Study in Finland.MethodsHeritability estimates for type 2 diabetes adjusted for sex, age and BMI are provided for different age groups of type 2 diabetes and for 34 clinical and metabolic traits in 5,810 individuals from 942 families using a variance component model (SOLAR). In addition, family means of these traits and their distribution across families are calculated.ResultsThe strongest heritability for type 2 diabetes was seen in patients with age at onset 35\textendash{}60 years (h 2 = 0.69). However, including patients with onset up to 75 years dropped the h 2 estimates to 0.31. Among quantitative traits, the highest h 2 estimates in all individuals and in non-diabetic individuals were seen for lean body mass (h 2 = 0.53\textendash{}0.65), HDL-cholesterol (0.52\textendash{}0.61) and suppression of NEFA during OGTT (0.63\textendash{}0.76) followed by measures of insulin secretion (insulinogenic index [IG30] = 0.41\textendash{}0.50) and insulin action (insulin sensitivity index [ISI] = 0.37\textendash{}0.40). In contrast, physical activity showed rather low heritability (0.16\textendash{}0.18), whereas smoking showed strong heritability (0.57\textendash{}0.59). Family means of these traits differed two- to fivefold between families belonging to the lowest and highest quartile of the trait (p {$<$} 0.00001).Conclusions/interpretationTo detect stronger genetic effects in type 2 diabetes, it seems reasonable to restrict inclusion of patients to those with age at onset 35\textendash{}60 years. Sequencing of families with extreme quantitative traits could be an important next step in the dissection of the genetics of type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {To elucidate the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors on the development of Type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, we examined a sample of twins (n = 606) ascertained from the population-based Danish Twin Register. Based on a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and current WHO criteria we identified 62 pairs in which one or both had Type II diabetes. The probandwise concordance (monozygotic: 0.50; dizygotic: 0.37) for Type II diabetes per se was not very different. When including the twins with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), however, the probandwise concordance for abnormal glucose tolerance was significantly different between monozygotic (0.63) and dizygotic (0.43) twin pairs, (p {$<$} 0.01). These findings were supported by the heritability estimates for Type II diabetes per se (26\%) and for abnormal glucose tolerance (61\%). The metabolic variables, insulin resistance and insulin secretion, and anthropometric variables, body mass index and waist to hip ratio, known to be associated with the development of glucose intolerance had a heritability of 26, 50, 80 and 6\% respectively. This study confirms the notion of a multifactorial aetiology of Type II diabetes. It supports the contribution of non-genetic aetiological components in the development of Type II diabetes per se. The study also indicates a role for genes in the aetiology of abnormal glucose tolerance. We therefore propose that genetic predisposition is important for the development of abnormal glucose tolerance. Non-genetic factors, however, might play a predominant role in controlling whether a genetically predisposed individual progresses to overt Type II diabetes.},

We used data from 27 low-income extended Mexican American pedigrees consisting of 440 individuals for whom genotypic data are available for 379 markers. We used a variance-components technique to conduct multipoint linkage analyses for two phenotypes: type 2 diabetes (a discrete trait) and age at onset of diabetes (a truncated quantitative trait). For the multipoint analyses, a subset of 295 markers was selected on the basis of optimal spacing and informativeness. We found significant evidence that a susceptibility locus near the marker D10S587 on chromosome 10q influences age at onset of diabetes (LOD score 3.75) and is also linked with type 2 diabetes itself (LOD score 2.88). This susceptibility locus explains 63.8\%+/-9.9\% (P=. 000016) of the total phenotypic variation in age at onset of diabetes and 65.7\%+/-10.9\% (P=.000135) of the total variation in liability to type 2 diabetes. Weaker evidence was found for linkage of diabetes and of age at onset to regions on chromosomes 3p, 4q, and 9p. In conclusion, our strongest evidence for linkage to both age at onset of diabetes and type 2 diabetes itself in the Mexican American population was for a region on chromosome 10q.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are the method most often used by geneticists to interrogate the human genome, and they provide a cost-effective way to identify the genetic variants underpinning complex traits and diseases. Most initial GWASs have focused on genetically homogeneous cohorts from European populations given the limited availability of ethnic minority samples and so as to limit population stratification effects. Transethnic studies have been invaluable in explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits, such as height, and in examining the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. They provide an opportunity for large-scale signal replication in independent populations and for cross-population meta-analyses to boost statistical power. In addition, transethnic GWASs enable prioritization of candidate genes, fine-mapping of functional variants, and potentially identification of SNPs associated with disease risk in admixed populations, by taking advantage of natural differences in genomic linkage disequilibrium across ethnically diverse populations. Recent efforts to assess the biological function of variants identified by GWAS have highlighted the need for large-scale replication, meta-analyses and fine-mapping across worldwide populations of ethnically diverse genetic ancestries. Here, we review recent advances and new approaches that are important to consider when performing, designing or interpreting transethnic GWASs, and we highlight existing challenges, such as the limited ability to handle heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium across populations and limitations in dissecting complex architectures, such as those found in recently admixed populations.},

While genome-wide association studies have successfully identified hundreds of type 2 diabetes loci throughout the genome, the vast majority of these reside in non-coding DNA, which complicates the process of determining their functional significance and level of priority for further study. Here we review the methods used to experimentally annotate these non-coding variants, to nominate causal variants and to link them to diabetes pathophysiology. In recent years, chromatin profiling, massively parallel sequencing, high-throughput reporter assays and CRISPR gene editing technologies have rapidly become indispensable tools. Rather than treating individual variants in isolation, we discuss the importance of accounting for context, both genetic (such as flanking DNA sequence) and environmental (such as cellular state or environmental exposure). Incorporating these features shows promise in terms of revealing biologically convergent molecular signatures across distant and seemingly unrelated loci. Studying regulatory elements in the proper context will be crucial for interpreting the functional significance of disease-associated variants and applying the resulting knowledge to improve patient care.},

We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2).

Although the proteins that read the gene regulatory code, transcription factors (TFs), have been largely identified, it is not well known which sequences TFs can recognize. We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA.},

  abstract = {The intersection of genome-wide association analyses with physiological and functional data indicates that variants regulating islet gene transcription influence type 2 diabetes (T2D) predisposition and glucose homeostasis. However, the specific genes through which these regulatory variants act remain poorly characterized. We generated expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data in 118 human islet samples using RNA-sequencing and high-density genotyping. We identified fourteen loci at which cis-exon-eQTL signals overlapped active islet chromatin signatures and were coincident with established T2D and/or glycemic trait associations. ‎At some, these data provide an experimental link between GWAS signals and biological candidates, such as DGKB and ADCY5. At others, the cis-signals implicate genes with no prior connection to islet biology, including WARS and ZMIZ1. At the ZMIZ1 locus, we show that perturbation of ZMIZ1 expression in human islets and beta-cells influences exocytosis and insulin secretion, highlighting a novel role for ZMIZ1 in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Together, these findings provide a significant advance in the mechanistic insights of T2D and glycemic trait association loci.},

These trans-eQTL signals confirmed and extended the previously reported KLF14-mediated network to 55 target genes, validated the CIITA regulation of class II MHC genes, and identified ZNF800 as a candidate master regulator. Finally, we observed similar expression-clinical trait correlations of genes associated with GWAS loci in both humans and a panel of genetically diverse mice. These results provide candidate genes for further investigation of their potential roles in adipose biology and in regulating cardio-metabolic traits.},

Genotype analysis revealed significant associations of 3 SNPs, rs508419 (first identified here), rs515071, and rs516946 with T2D (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (r2\,{$>$}\,0.80); subsequent analysis indicated that the CCC haplotype associated with increased T2D susceptibility (OR 1.447, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Further mapping showed that rs508419 resides in the muscle-specific ANK1 gene promoter. Allele-specific mRNA and protein level measurements confirmed association of the C allele with increased small ANK1 (sAnk1) expression in human skeletal muscle (P\,=\,0.018 and P\,{$<$}\,0.001, respectively). Luciferase assays showed increased rs508419-C allele transcriptional activity in murine skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays demonstrated altered rs508419 DNA-protein complex formation. Glucose uptake was decreased with excess sAnk1 expression upon insulin stimulation. Thus, the ANK1 rs508419-C T2D-risk allele alters DNA-protein complex binding leading to increased promoter activity and sAnk1 expression; thus, increased sAnk1 expression in skeletal muscle might contribute to T2D susceptibility.},

In recent years K2P channel isoforms have been identified as important targets of several widely employed drugs, including: general anesthetics, local anesthetics, neuroprotectants, and anti-depressants. An important goal of future studies will be to identify the basis of drug actions and channel isoform selectivity. This goal will be facilitated by characterization of native K2P channel isoforms, their pharmacological properties and tissue-specific expression patterns. To this end the present review examines the biophysical, pharmacological, and functional characteristics of cloned mammalian K2P channels and compares this information with the limited data available for native K2P channels in order to determine criteria which may be useful in identifying ionic currents mediated by native channel isoforms and investigating their pharmacological and functional characteristics.},

  abstract = {Mammals are composed of hundreds of different cell types with specialized functions. Each of these cellular phenotypes are controlled by different combinations of transcription factors. Using a human non islet cell insulinoma cell line (TC-YIK) which expresses insulin and the majority of known pancreatic beta cell specific genes as an example, we describe a general approach to identify key cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs) and their direct and indirect targets. By ranking all human TFs by their level of enriched expression in TC-YIK relative to a broad collection of samples (FANTOM5), we confirmed known key regulators of pancreatic function and development. Systematic siRNA mediated perturbation of these TFs followed by qRT-PCR revealed their interconnections with NEUROD1 at the top of the regulation hierarchy and its depletion drastically reducing insulin levels. For 15 of the TF knock-downs (KD), we then used Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) to identify thousands of their targets genome-wide (KD-CAGE). The data confirm NEUROD1 as a key positive regulator in the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), and ISL1, and PROX1 as antagonists. As a complimentary approach we used ChIP-seq on four of these factors to identify NEUROD1, LMX1A, PAX6, and RFX6 binding sites in the human genome. Examining the overlap between genes perturbed in the KD-CAGE experiments and genes with a ChIP-seq peak within 50 kb of their promoter, we identified direct transcriptional targets of these TFs. Integration of KD-CAGE and ChIP-seq data shows that both NEUROD1 and LMX1A work as the main transcriptional activators. In the core TRN (i.e., TF-TF only), NEUROD1 directly transcriptionally activates the pancreatic TFs HSF4, INSM1, MLXIPL, MYT1, NKX6-3, ONECUT2, PAX4, PROX1, RFX6, ST18, DACH1, and SHOX2, while LMX1A directly transcriptionally activates DACH1, SHOX2, PAX6, and PDX1. Analysis of these complementary datasets suggests the need for caution in interpreting ChIP-seq datasets. (1) A large fraction of binding sites are at distal enhancer sites and cannot be directly associated to their targets, without chromatin conformation data. (2) Many peaks may be non-functional: even when there is a peak at a promoter, the expression of the gene may not be affected in the matching perturbation experiment.},

We demonstrate the presence of RFX6 in adult human pancreatic endocrine cells. Using the recently developed human {$\beta$} cell line EndoC-{$\beta$}H2, we show that RFX6 regulates insulin gene transcription, insulin content, and secretion. Knockdown of RFX6 causes downregulation of Ca(2+)-channel genes resulting in the reduction in L-type Ca(2+)-channel activity that leads to suppression of depolarization-evoked insulin exocytosis. We also describe a previously unreported homozygous missense RFX6 mutation (p.V506G) that is associated with neonatal diabetes, which lacks the capacity to activate the insulin promoter and to increase Ca(2+)-channel expression. Our data therefore provide insights for understanding certain forms of neonatal diabetes.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3 or Ngn3) controls islet cell fate specification in multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells in the mouse embryo. However, our knowledge of the genetic programs implemented by Ngn3, which control generic and islet subtype-specific properties, is still fragmentary. Gene expression profiling in isolated Ngn3-positive progenitor cells resulted in the identification of the uncharacterized winged helix transcription factor Rfx6. Rfx6 is initially expressed broadly in the gut endoderm, notably in Pdx1-positive cells in the developing pancreatic buds, and then becomes progressively restricted to the endocrine lineage, suggesting a dual function in both endoderm development and islet cell differentiation. Rfx6 is found in postmitotic islet progenitor cells in the embryo and is maintained in all developing and adult islet cell types. Rfx6 is dependent on Ngn3 and acts upstream of or in parallel with NeuroD, Pax4 and Arx transcription factors during islet cell differentiation. In zebrafish, the Rfx6 ortholog is similarly found in progenitors and hormone expressing cells of the islet lineage. Loss-of-function studies in zebrafish revealed that rfx6 is required for the differentiation of glucagon-, ghrelin- and somatostatin-expressing cells, which, in the absence of rfx6, are blocked at the progenitor stage. By contrast, beta cells, whose number is only slightly reduced, were no longer clustered in a compact islet. These data unveil Rfx6 as a novel regulator of islet cell development.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Major advances have been made in the classification and genetics of monogenic diabetes in infancy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize different forms of diabetes diagnosed during the first year of life.
DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 1 year in 10 Finnish hospitals from 1980 to 2014 were included.
SETTING: The study was conducted at Kuopio University Hospital and University of Eastern Finland.
PATIENTS: Patients were identified through diagnosis-based searches from hospital registries including 93 children, of whom 64 participated.
INTERVENTIONS: DNA sample for sequencing, serum sample, and medical records interventions were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of diabetes during the first year of life, sequencing results, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, and islet autoantibodies were measured.
RESULTS: The incidence of diabetes diagnosed during the first 12 months was 4.4/100 000/year. Three novel and 11 previously described mutations were found in 22 patients from 15 families in the KCNJ11, ABCC8, INS, GCK, FOXP, STAT3, and RFX6 genes. Positive islet autoantibodies were observed in 40.0\% of the patients diagnosed during the first 0-6 months of life vs 70.8\% of the patients diagnosed between ages of 7 to 12 months. A total of 85.7\% of the patients carrying protective HLA genotypes were mutation-positive compared to 7.7\% of the patients having high-risk genotypes (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the K-ATP channel and INS genes were the most common cause of early diagnosed monogenic diabetes. After 6 months of age, patients with diabetes had high HLA risk genotypes and islet autoantibodies, reflecting the autoimmune character of diabetes in that age group.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable.
RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us.
AVAILABILITY: Our robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a freely available software package, KING, available for download at http://people.virginia.edu/{$\sim$}wc9c/KING.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

In this paper, we describe methods to identify within-species DNA sample contamination based on (1) a combination of sequencing reads and array-based genotype data, (2) sequence reads alone, and (3) array-based genotype data alone. Analysis of sequencing reads allows contamination detection after sequence data is generated but prior to variant calling; analysis of array-based genotype data allows contamination detection prior to generation of costly sequence data. Through a combination of analysis of in~silico and experimentally contaminated samples, we show that our methods can reliably detect and estimate levels of contamination as low as 1\%. We evaluate the impact of DNA contamination on genotype accuracy and propose effective strategies to screen for and prevent DNA contamination in sequencing studies.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis links variations in gene expression levels to genotypes. For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for eQTL analysis grows stronger.
RESULTS: We have developed a new software for computationally efficient eQTL analysis called Matrix eQTL. In tests on large datasets, it was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for QTL/eQTL analysis, while finding the same eQTLs. The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-eQTLs.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 70 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but for most, the underlying causal variants, associated genes, and functional mechanisms remain unknown. At a T2D- and fasting-proinsulin-associated locus on 11q13.4, we have identified a functional regulatory DNA variant, a candidate target gene, and a plausible underlying molecular mechanism. Fine mapping, conditional analyses, and exome array genotyping in 8,635 individuals from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men study confirmed a single major association signal between fasting proinsulin and noncoding variants (p = 7.4 \texttimes{} 10(-50)). Measurement of allele-specific mRNA levels in human pancreatic islet samples heterozygous for rs11603334 showed that the T2D-risk and proinsulin-decreasing allele (C) is associated with increased ARAP1 expression (p {$<$} 0.02). We evaluated four candidate functional SNPs for allelic effects on transcriptional activity by performing reporter assays in rodent pancreatic beta cell lines. The C allele of rs11603334, located near one of the ARAP1 promoters, exhibited 2-fold higher transcriptional activity than did the T allele (p {$<$} 0.0001); three other candidate SNPs showed no allelic differences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated decreased binding of pancreatic beta cell transcriptional regulators PAX6 and PAX4 to the rs11603334 C allele. Collectively, these data suggest that the T2D-risk allele of rs11603334 could abrogate binding of a complex containing PAX6 and PAX4 and thus lead to increased promoter activity and ARAP1 expression in human pancreatic islets. This work suggests that increased ARAP1 expression might contribute to T2D susceptibility at this GWAS locus.},

We have applied AlleleSeq to variation data for NA12878 from the 1000 Genomes Project as well as matched, deeply sequenced RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data sets generated for this purpose. In addition to observing fairly widespread allele-specific behavior within individual functional genomic data sets (including results consistent with X-chromosome inactivation), we can study the interaction between ASE and ASB.

  abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project and disease-specific sequencing efforts are producing large collections of haplotypes that can be used as reference panels for genotype imputation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, imputing from large reference panels with existing methods imposes a high computational burden. We introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that maintains the accuracy of leading methods while reducing computational costs. We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the 1000 Genomes Project. This strategy will be particularly valuable for repeated imputation as reference panels evolve.},

  abstract = {Gene expression measurements are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as the state of the cell, experimental conditions and variants in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27\% of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs in human than previously shown.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

Here, we provide a direct window into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by sequencing RNA from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory variation - by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first time we identify thousands of variants associated with specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression. Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal and trans (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further, generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the genomic properties of variants associated with expression and splicing, and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies. Together, these results represent a critical step toward characterizing the complete landscape of human regulatory variation.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by abnormalities in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. The causes of type 2 diabetes are multifactorial and include both genetic and environmental elements that affect beta-cell function and tissue (muscle, liver, adipose tissue, pancreas) insulin sensitivity. Although there is considerable debate as to the relative contributions of beta-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin sensitivity to the pathogenesis of diabetes, it is generally agreed that both these factors play important roles. However, the mechanisms controlling the interplay of these two impairments are unclear. A number of factors have been suggested as possibly linking insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. A majority of individuals suffering from type 2 diabetes are obese, with central visceral adiposity. Therefore, the adipose tissue should play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Although the predominant paradigm used to explain this link is the portal/visceral hypothesis giving a key role in elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations, two new emerging paradigms are the ectopic fat storage syndrome (deposition of triglycerides in muscle, liver and pancreatic cells) and the adipose tissue as endocrine organ hypothesis (secretion of various adipocytokins, i.e. leptin, TNF-{$\alpha$}, resistin, adiponectin, implicated in insulin resistance and possibly beta-cell dysfunction). These two paradigms constitute the framework for the study of the interplay between insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes as well as between our obesogenic environment and diabetes risk in the next decade.},

The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue. Point 1 \textendash{} Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as type I error control (i.e. type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems. Point 2 \textendash{} When a test has problems with type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement. Point 3 \textendash{}Tests based on models that better fit the data (e.g. a negative binomial for overdispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power. We illustrate these issues for a 2 \texttimes{} 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using LMs or GLMs can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed. We conclude that, when GLMs are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct type I error rates, they should be used rather than LMs. Nonetheless, standard LM tests are often robust and can have good type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.},

Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments.

Spatial positions of cells in tissues strongly influence function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type\textendash{}specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. These studies highlight how Slide-seq provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.

Long-duration missions that will take humans to Mars and beyond are planned by public and private entities for the 2020s and 2030s; therefore, comprehensive studies are needed now to assess the impact of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, brain, and overall physiology. The space environment is made harsh and challenging by multiple factors, including confinement, isolation, and exposure to environmental stressors such as microgravity, radiation, and noise. The selection of one of a pair of monozygotic (identical) twin astronauts for NASA's first 1-year mission enabled us to compare the impact of the spaceflight environment on one twin to the simultaneous impact of the Earth environment on a genetically matched subject.
RATIONALEThe known impacts of the spaceflight environment on human health and performance, physiology, and cellular and molecular processes are numerous and include bone density loss, effects on cognitive performance, microbial shifts, and alterations in gene regulation. However, previous studies collected very limited data, did not integrate simultaneous effects on multiple systems and data types in the same subject, or were restricted to 6-month missions. Measurement of the same variables in an astronaut on a year-long mission and in his Earth-bound twin indicated the biological measures that might be used to determine the effects of spaceflight. Presented here is an integrated longitudinal, multidimensional description of the effects of a 340-day mission onboard the International Space Station.
RESULTSPhysiological, telomeric, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic, immune, microbiomic, cardiovascular, vision-related, and cognitive data were collected over 25 months. Some biological functions were not significantly affected by spaceflight, including the immune response (T cell receptor repertoire) to the first test of a vaccination in flight. However, significant changes in multiple data types were observed in association with the spaceflight period; the majority of these eventually returned to a preflight state within the time period of the study. These included changes in telomere length, gene regulation measured in both epigenetic and transcriptional data, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, subfoveal choroidal thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness, and serum metabolites. In addition, some factors were significantly affected by the stress of returning to Earth, including inflammation cytokines and immune response gene networks, as well as cognitive performance. For a few measures, persistent changes were observed even after 6 months on Earth, including some genes' expression levels, increased DNA damage from chromosomal inversions, increased numbers of short telomeres, and attenuated cognitive function.
CONCLUSIONGiven that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight. The persistence of the molecular changes (e.g., gene expression) and the extrapolation of the identified risk factors for longer missions ({$>$}1 year) remain estimates and should be demonstrated with these measures in future astronauts. Finally, changes described in this study highlight pathways and mechanisms that may be vulnerable to spaceflight and may require safeguards for longer space missions; thus, they serve as a guide for targeted countermeasures or monitoring during future missions. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6436/eaau8650/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Multidimensional, longitudinal assays of the NASA Twins Study.(Left and middle) Genetically identical twin subjects (ground and flight) were characterized across 10 generalized biomedical modalities before (preflight), during (inflight), and after flight (postflight) for a total of 25 months (circles indicate time points at which data were collected). (Right) Data were integrated to guide biomedical metrics across various ``-omes'' for future missions (concentric circles indicate, from inner to outer, cytokines, proteome, transcriptome, and methylome).
To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress\textendash{}related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight.
An integrated analysis reveals the changes, down to the molecular level, in one man during a year-long spaceflight.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Motivation: Genome-wide profiles of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in diverse cellular contexts are critical to decipher the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to learn predictive cis-regulatory DNA sequence models of context- specific chromatin accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across cell types. Results: We introduce multi-modal, residual neural network architectures that integrate cis-regulatory sequence and context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular contexts. We show that the average accessibility of a genomic region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies for training models to enhance genome-wide prediction of shared and context-specific chromatin accessible sites across cell types. We interpret the models to reveal insights into cis and trans regulation of chromatin dynamics across 123 diverse cellular contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {By integrating an agonist satiety signal, provided by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and an antagonist signal, provided by agouti-related protein (AGRP), the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is a key element in the hypothalamic control of food intake. Inactivation of the gene encoding this G protein-coupled receptor causes obesity in mice. In humans, frameshift mutations in MC4-R cause an early-onset dominant form of obesity in two families. In this study we find a high frequency (4\%) of rare heterozygous MC4-R mutations in a large population of morbidly obese patients. No such mutations were found in controls. By analyzing the phenotypes of the probands carrying these mutations, we demonstrate that these patients display a common, nonsyndromic form of obesity. Interestingly, functional analysis of the mutant receptors indicates that obesity-associated defects in MC4-R range from loss of function to constitutive activation. Transmission of these mutations in the families of the carriers indicates a variable expressivity that is not related to the functional severity of the mutations. This variable expressivity of MC4-R-associated obesity is not due to variations in genes for alpha-MSH or AGRP. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MC4-R mutations are a frequent but heterogeneous genetic cause of morbid obesity.},

  abstract = {The Greenlandic population, a small and historically isolated founder population comprising about 57,000 inhabitants, has experienced a dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence during the past 25 years1. Motivated by this, we performed association mapping of T2D-related quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without known diabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the gene TBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17\%. Here we show that homozygous carriers of this variant have markedly higher concentrations of plasma glucose ({$\beta$} = 3.8 mmol l-1, P = 2.5 \texttimes{} 10-35) and serum insulin ({$\beta$} = 165 pmol l-1, P = 1.5 \texttimes{} 10-20) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose ({$\beta$} = -0.18 mmol l-1, P = 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-6) and fasting serum insulin ({$\beta$} = -8.3 pmol l-1, P = 0.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3, P = 1.6 \texttimes{} 10-24). Heterozygous carriers have a moderately higher plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers ({$\beta$} = 0.43 mmol l-1, P = 5.3 \texttimes{} 10-5). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits2,3,4 and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations.},

We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment and appear to do so with significant effects to promote weight loss with minimal hypoglycemia. In addition, there are significant data with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showing efficacy comparable to sulfonylureas but with weight neutral effects and reduced risk for hypoglycemia. However, over the recent past there have been concerns reported regarding the long-term consequences of using such therapies, and the issues raised are in regard to the potential of both classes to promote acute pancreatitis, to initiate histological changes suggesting chronic pancreatitis including associated preneoplastic lesions, and potentially, in the long run, pancreatic cancer. Other issues relate to a potential risk for the increase in thyroid cancer. There are clearly conflicting data that have been presented in preclinical studies and in epidemiologic studies. To provide an understanding of both sides of the argument, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part point-counterpoint narrative. In the point narrative below, Dr. Butler and colleagues provide their opinion and review of the data to date and that we need to reconsider the use of incretin-based therapies because of the growing concern of potential risk and based on a clearer understanding of the mechanism of action. In the counterpoint narrative following the contribution by Dr. Butler and colleagues, Dr. Nauck provides a defense of incretin-based therapies and that the benefits clearly outweigh any concern of risk.},

Accordingly, in~insulin-secreting cells, melatonin reduced cAMP levels, and MTNR1B overexpression exaggerated the inhibition of insulin release exerted by melatonin. Conversely, mice with a disruption of~the receptor secreted more insulin. Melatonin treatment in a human recall-by-genotype study reduced insulin secretion and raised glucose levels more extensively in risk G-allele carriers.

  abstract = {Gene expression variation is a major contributor to phenotypic variation in human complex traits. Selection on complex traits may therefore be reflected in constraint on gene expression. Here, we explore the effects of stabilizing selection on cis-regulatory genetic variation in humans. We analyze patterns of expression variation at copy number variants and find evidence for selection against large increases in gene expression. Using allele-specific expression (ASE) data, we further show evidence of selection against smaller-effect variants. We estimate that, across all genes, singletons in a sample of 122 individuals have {$\sim$}2.2\texttimes{} greater effects on expression variation than the average variant across allele frequencies. Despite their increased effect size relative to common variants, we estimate that singletons in the sample studied explain, on average, only 5\% of the heritability of gene expression from cis-regulatory variants. Finally, we show that genes depleted for loss-of-function variants are also depleted for cis-eQTLs and have low levels of allelic imbalance, confirming tighter constraint on the expression levels of these genes. We conclude that constraint on gene expression is present, but has relatively weak effects on most cis-regulatory variants, thus permitting high levels of gene-regulatory genetic variation.},

In recent years, a number of dedicated RNA-seq technologies were developed to measure specifically transcription events. Global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) is the most widely used method to measure nascent RNA, and in recent years, it has been applied successfully to study the function and mechanism of action of noncoding RNAs.

  abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a key factor that regulates the behavior and fate of prostate cancer cells. The AR-regulated network is activated when AR binds enhancer elements and modulates specific enhancer\textendash{}promoter looping. Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. Here, we demonstrate that KLK3e facilitates the spatial interaction of the KLK3 enhancer and the KLK2 promoter and enhances long-distance KLK2 transcriptional activation. KLK3e carries the core enhancer element derived from the androgen response element III (ARE III), which is required for the interaction of AR and Mediator 1 (Med1). Furthermore, we show that KLK3e processes RNA-dependent enhancer activity depending on the integrity of core enhancer elements. The transcription of KLK3e was detectable and its expression is significantly correlated with KLK3 (R2 = 0.6213, P {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-11) and KLK2 (R2 = 0.5893, P {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-10) in human prostate tissues. Interestingly, RNAi silencing of KLK3e resulted in a modest negative effect on prostate cancer cell proliferation. Accordingly, we report that an androgen-induced eRNA scaffolds the AR-associated protein complex that modulates chromosomal architecture and selectively enhances AR-dependent gene expression.},

  abstract = {Summary
Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model in which lineage-determining factors act in a collaborative manner to select and prime cell-specific enhancers, thereby enabling signal-dependent transcription factors to bind and function in a cell-type-specific manner. Consistent with this model, TLR4 signaling primarily regulates macrophage gene expression through a pre-existing enhancer landscape. However, TLR4 signaling also induces priming of {$\sim$}3,000 enhancer-like regions de novo, enabling visualization of intermediates in enhancer selection and activation.~Unexpectedly, we find that enhancer transcription precedes local mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). H3K4 methylation at de~novo enhancers is primarily dependent on the histone methyltransferases Mll1, Mll2/4, and Mll3 and is significantly reduced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest an essential role of enhancer transcription in~H3K4me1/2 deposition at de novo enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting eRNA transcripts.},

  issn = {2045-2322},
  abstract = {The human DHRS4 gene cluster consists of DHRS4 and two immediately downstream homologous genes, DHRS4L2 and DHRS4L1, generated by evolutionarily gene-duplication events. We previously demonstrated that a head-to-head natural antisense transcript (NAT) of DHRS4, denoted DHRS4-AS1, regulates all three genes of the DHRS4 gene cluster. However, it is puzzling that DHRS4L2 and DHRS4L1 did not evolve their own specific NATs to regulate themselves, as it seems both have retained sequences highly homologous to DHRS4-AS1. In a search of the DHRS4-AS1 region for nearby enhancers, we identified an enhancer located 13.8 kb downstream of the DHRS4-AS1 transcriptional start site. We further showed, by using a chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay, that this enhancer is capable of physically interacting with the DHRS4-AS1 promoter through chromosomal looping. The enhancer produced an eRNA, termed AS1eRNA, that enhanced DHRS4-AS1 transcription by mediating the spatial interactions of the enhancer and DHRS4-AS1 promoter in cooperation with RNA polymerase II and p300/CBP. Moreover, the distributions of activating acetyl-H3 and H3K4me3 modifications were found to be greater at the DHRS4-AS1 promoter than at the homologous duplicated regions. We propose that AS1eRNA-driven DNA looping and activating histone modifications promote the expression of DHRS4-AS1 to economically control the DHRS4 gene cluster.},

However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17{$\beta$}-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor {$\alpha$} (ER-{$\alpha$}) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of specific enhancer\textendash{}promoter looping initiated by ER-{$\alpha$} binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-{$\alpha$}-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing E2/ER-{$\alpha$}/eRNA-induced enhancer\textendash{}promoter looping.

Using MAP-C, we show that inducible interchromosomal pairing between HAS1pr-TDA1pr alleles in saturated cultures of Saccharomyces yeast is mediated by three transcription factors, Leu3, Sdd4 (Ypr022c), and Rgt1. The coincident, combined binding of all three factors is strongest at the HAS1pr-TDA1pr locus and is also specific to saturated conditions. We applied MAP-C to further explore the biochemical mechanism of these contacts, and find they require the structured regulatory domain of Rgt1, but no known interaction partners of Rgt1. Altogether, our results demonstrate MAP-C as a powerful method for dissecting the mechanistic basis of chromosome conformation.},

We cloned candidate fragments at the position of the core promoter (also called minimal promoter) in reporter plasmids with or without a strong enhancer, transfected the resulting library into cells, and quantified the transcripts that initiated from each candidate for each setup by deep sequencing. In the presence of a single strong enhancer, the enhancer responsiveness of different sequences differs by several orders of magnitude, and different levels of responsiveness are associated with genes of different functions. We also identify sequence features that predict enhancer responsiveness and discuss how different core promoters are employed for the regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Summary
Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mammalian tissues are composed of highly specialized cell types defined by distinct gene expression patterns. Identification of cis-regulatory elements responsible for cell-type specific gene expression is essential for understanding the origin of the cellular diversity. Conventional assays to map cis-elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues fail to resolve their cell type specificity and lack the sensitivity to identify cis-elements in rare cell types. Single nucleus analysis of transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation, but current analysis methods begin with pre-defined genomic regions of accessibility and are therefore biased toward the dominant population of a tissue. Here we report a method, Single Nucleus Analysis Pipeline for ATAC-seq (SnapATAC), that can efficiently dissect cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner using single nucleus ATAC-seq datasets and identify candidate regulatory sequences in constituent cell types. We demonstrate that SnapATAC outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and scalability. We further analyze 64,795 single cell chromatin profiles from the secondary motor cortex of mouse brain, creating a chromatin landscape atlas with unprecedent resolution, including over 300,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements in nearly 50 distinct cell populations. These results demonstrate a systematic approach for comprehensive analysis of cis-regulatory sequences in the mammalian genomes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Regulatory and coding variants are known to be enriched with associations identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of complex disease, but their contributions to trait heritability are currently unknown. We applied variance-component methods to imputed genotype data for 11 common diseases to partition the heritability explained by genotyped SNPs (hg(2)) across functional categories (while accounting for shared variance due to linkage disequilibrium). Extensive simulations showed that in contrast to current estimates from GWAS summary statistics, the variance-component approach partitions heritability accurately under a wide range of complex-disease architectures. Across the 11 diseases DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) from 217 cell types spanned 16\% of imputed SNPs (and 24\% of genotyped SNPs) but explained an average of 79\% (SE = 8\%) of hg(2) from imputed SNPs (5.1\texttimes{} enrichment; p = 3.7~\texttimes{} 10(-17)) and 38\% (SE = 4\%) of hg(2) from genotyped SNPs (1.6\texttimes{} enrichment, p = 1.0~\texttimes{} 10(-4)). Further enrichment was observed at enhancer DHSs and cell-type-specific DHSs. In contrast, coding variants, which span 1\% of the genome, explained {$<$}10\% of hg(2) despite having the highest enrichment. We replicated these findings but found no significant contribution from rare coding variants in independent schizophrenia cohorts genotyped on GWAS and exome chips. Our results highlight the value of analyzing components of heritability to unravel the functional architecture of common disease.},

Although each such data track is independently informative toward the annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements. To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary of the massive datasets of the ENCODE Project, we apply unsupervised learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay between chromatin activity and RNA transcription, and reveal that a large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary constraint in human.

A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection.

Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions.

In this paper adjustments to these methods are proposed, using a new eigenvalue-based measure of the effective number of independent tests to which the actual tests performed are equivalent, and are compared with adjustments proposed by previous authors. The adjusted methods are evaluated using a sample of 726 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and 707 group-matched controls, genotyped at 84,975 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in 2,000 randomly chosen genes. The tests for genetic association with AD at loci within each gene are combined. The number of loci tested per gene varies from 2 to 994. The adjusted combined p-values agree well with the significance of the combined p-values determined empirically by random permutation of the data (Sid{\'a}k correction: r=0.990; Fisher's method: r=0.994). This indicates that the combined p-values can be used to assess the relative strength of evidence for association of these genes with AD. The adjustment proposed here is a refinement of that of Nyholt ([2004] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 74:765-769), giving improved agreement with the results of random permutation. The improvement obtained is similar to that given by the refinement proposed by Li and Ji ([2005] Heredity 95:221-227). It is concluded that the concept of an effective number of tests is a valid approximation that allows p-values to be combined in a highly informative way.},
